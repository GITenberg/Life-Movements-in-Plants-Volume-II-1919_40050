<h3>PREFACE TO VOLUME II.</h3>


<p>I have in the present volume dealt with the intricate
phenomena of different tropisms. The movements in plants
under the stimuli of the environment&mdash;the twining of
tendrils, the effect of temperature, the action of light
inducing movements sometimes towards and at other times
away from the stimulus, the diametrically opposite responses
of the shoot and the root to the same stimulus of gravity,
the day and night positions of organs of plants&mdash;these, and
many others present such diversities that it must have
appeared a hopeless endeavour to discover any fundamental
reaction applicable in all cases. It has therefore been
customary to assume different sensibilities especially evolved
for the advantage of the plant. But teleological argument
and the use of descriptive phrases, like positive
and negative tropism, offer no real explanation of the
phenomena. Thus to quote Pfeffer "When we say that an
organ curves towards a source of illumination, because of
its heliotropic irritability we are simply expressing an
ascertained fact in a conveniently abbreviated form, without
explaining why such curvature is possible or how it is
produced.... Many observers have unfortunately devoted
their attention to artificially classifying the phenomenon
observed, and have entirely neglected the explanation of
causes underlying them." He also adds that in regard to
the phenomenon of growth and its variations, an empirical
<span class='pagenum'>[ii]</span>
treatment is all that is possible in the present state of our
knowledge; but deduction from results of experimental
investigation "still remains the ideal of physiology, and only
when this ideal has been attained, shall we be able to
obtain a comprehensive view of the interacting factors at
work in the living organism."</p>

<p>In my previous work on "Plant Response" (1906) I
described detailed investigations on irritability of plants
which I carried out with highly sensitive recorders. The
plant was thus made to tell its own story by means of
its self-made records. The results showed that there is
no specific difference in physiological reaction of different
organs to justify the assumption of positive and negative
irritabilities. A generalisation was obtained which gave a
complete explanation of diverse movements in plants.
The results were fully confirmed by an independent method
of inquiry, namely that of electric response, which I have
been able to elaborate so as to become a very important
means of research.</p>

<p>The investigations described in the present volume
not only support the conclusions reached in my earlier
works, but have led to important additions. It is evident
that the range of our investigation is limited only by
our power of recording the rate of plant-movement,
that is to say, in the measurement of length and time.
In these respects the instruments that I have been able
to devise have surpassed my sanguine expectations. The
Resonant Recorder traces time-intervals as short as a
<span class='pagenum'>[iii]</span>
thousandth part of a second, while my Balanced Crescograph
enables us to measure variation of rate of growth as
minute as <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>1000</sub> millionth of an inch per second, the sensitiveness
of this apparatus thus rivals that of the spectroscope.
The increasing refinement in our experimental
methods cannot but lead to important advances towards
a deeper understanding of underlying reactions in the
living organism.</p>

<p>I shall here draw attention to only a few of the
important results given in the present volume. The tropic
effect of light has been shown to have a definite relation
to the quantity of incident light. A complete tropic
curve has been obtained from sub-minimal to maximal
stimulation which shows the inadequacy of Weber's law,
for the sub-minimal stimulus induces a <i>qualitative</i> difference
in physiological reaction. It has further been shown
that the prevalent idea that perception and heliotropic
excitation are two distinct phenomena is without any
foundation.</p>

<p>With reference to the effect of ether waves on plants,
I have given an account of my discovery of the response
of all plants to wireless stimulation, the results being
similar to that induced by visible light. The perceptive
range of the plant is thus infinitely greater than ours;
for it not only perceives, but also responds to different
rays of the vast ethereal spectrum.</p>

<p>The results obtained by the method of geo-electric
response show that the responsive reaction of the root
<span class='pagenum'>[iv]</span>
is in no way different from that of the shoot, the opposite
movements being due to the fact that in the shoot the
stimulation is direct, and in the root it is indirect.</p>

<p>Full description is given of the new method of
physiological exploration by means of the electric probe,
by which the particular layer which perceives the
stimulus of gravity is definitely localised. The method
of electric probe is also found to be of extended application
in the detection of physiological changes in the
interior of an organ.</p>

<p>An important factor of nyctitropic movements, hitherto
unsuspected, is the effect of variation of temperature
on geotropic curvature. This and other co-operative factors
have been fully analysed, and a satisfactory explanation
has been offered of various types of diurnal movement.</p>

<p>A generalisation has been obtained which explains
all the diverse movements of plants, under all modes of
stimulation: <i>it has been shown that direct stimulation
induces contraction and retardation of growth, and that
indirect stimulation induces an expansion and acceleration
of growth.</i></p>

<p>Another generalisation of still greater importance is the
establishment of identical nature of physiological reaction in
the plant and the animal, leading to advances in general
physiology. Thus the discovery of a method for immediate
enhancement or inhibition of nervous impulse in the plant
led to my success in the control of nervous impulse in the
animal. Another important discovery was the dual nervous
<span class='pagenum'>[v]</span>
impulses in plants, and I have very recently been able to
establish, that the nervous impulse generated in the animal
nerve by stimulus is not single, but double.</p>

<p>The study of the responsive phenomena in plants must
thus form an integral part of physiological investigation
into various problems relating to the irritability of all living
tissues, and without such study the investigation must in
future remain incomplete.</p>

<h3><i>By</i><br />

<br /><span class="smcap">Sir J. C. Bose.</span></h3>


<p>We shall in the succeeding series of papers deal with
the subject of tropism in general. Different plant organs
undergo curvature or bending, sometimes towards and at
other times away from the stimulus which induces it.
The problem is very intricate; the possibility of its solution
will depend greatly on the accurate determination of
the immediate and after-effects of various stimuli on the
responding organ. The curvature induced in the growing
organ is brought about by variation, often extremely slight,
of the rate of growth; the result, moreover, is liable to
be modified by the duration and point of application of
stimulus. The difficulties connected with the problem can
only be removed by the detection and measurement of the
minutest variation in growth, and by securing a continuous
and automatic record of the entire history of the change.</p>

<p>In the chapter on High Magnification Crescograph an
account is given of the apparatus which I have devised
by which the rate of growth may be magnified from ten
thousand to ten millions times. It is thus possible to
measure the imperceptible growth of plants for a period
shorter than a single second. The variation of normal
rate of growth is also found by measuring successive
growth records on a stationary plate at regular intervals,
say of ten seconds, or from the flexure in the growth-curve
taken on a moving plate (p. 163).</p>

<p>I was next desirous of exalting the sensitiveness to a
still higher degree by an independent method, which would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
not only reveal very slight variation induced in the rate
of growth, but also the latent period and time-relations of
the change. For this purpose I at first devised the Optical
Method of Balance<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> which was considered at the time to
be extremely sensitive. The spot of light from the Optical
Lever (which magnified the rate of growth) was made to
fall upon a mirror to which a compensating movement
was imparted so that the light-spot after double reflection
remained stationary. Any change of rate of growth&mdash;acceleration
or retardation&mdash;was at once detected by the
movement of the hitherto stationary spot of light in one
direction or the other.</p>

<p>A very careful manipulation was required for the
adjustment of the Optical Balance; the record moreover
was not automatic. For these reasons I have been
engaged for several years past in perfecting a new apparatus
by which, (1) the balance could be directly obtained
with the utmost exactitude, (2) where an attached scale
would indicate the exact rate of growth, and (3) in which
the upsetting of the balance by external stimulus would
be automatically recorded, the curve giving the time relations
of the change.</p>


<h4>PRINCIPLE OF THE METHOD OF BALANCE.</h4>

<p>I shall take a concrete example in explanation of the
method of balance. Taking the rate of growth per second
of a plant to be <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>50,000</sub> inch or 0&middot;5 &micro;, per second (equal
to the wave length of sodium light), the tip of the plant
will be maintained at the same point in space if we succeeded
in making the plant-holder subside exactly at the
same rate. The growth-elongation of the plant will then
be exactly balanced by a compensating movement downwards.
The state of exact balance is indicated when the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
recording lever of the Crescograph traces a horizontal line
on the moving plate. Overbalance or underbalance will
deflect the record below or above the horizontal line.</p>

<h4>COMPENSATING MOVEMENT.</h4>

<p>For securing exact balance the holder of the plant P, in
the given example, will have to subside at a rate of <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>50,000</sub>
inch per second. This is accomplished by a system of
reducing worm and pinion, also of clock wheels (Fig. 93).
The clock at first used for this purpose was worked by
the usual balance wheel. Though this secured an <i>average</i>
balance yet as each tick of the clock consisted of sudden
movement and stoppage, it caused minute variation in the
rate of subsidence; this became magnified by the Crescograph
and appeared as a series of oscillations about a
mean position of equilibrium. This particular defect was
obviated by the substitution of a fan governor for the
balance wheel. But the speed of rotation slows down with
the unwinding of the main spring, and the balance obtained
at the beginning was found to be insufficient later on.
The difficulty was finally overcome by the use of a heavy
weight W, in the place of coiled spring.  The complete
apparatus is seen in figure 94.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 640px;">

</div>

<p>For purpose of simplicity of explanation, I assumed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
the growth rate to have a definite value of <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>50,000</sub> inch per
second. But the rate varies widely in different plants and
even in the same plant at different days and seasons. In
practice the rate of growth for which compensation has
to be made varies from <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>150,000</sub> to <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>25,000</sub> inch, or from 0&middot;17 &micro;
to 1&middot;0 &micro; per second. We have thus to secure some means of
<i>continuous</i> adjustment for growth, the rate of which could
be continuously varied from one to six times. This range
of adjustment I have been able to secure by the compound
method of frictional resistance and of centrifugal
governor. As regards frictional resistance the two pointed
ends of a hinged fork rub against a horizontal circular plate
not shown in the figure. By means of the screw head S,
the free ends of the fork spread out and the circumference
of the frictional circle continuously increased. The
centrifugal governor is also spread out by the action of
the adjusting screw. By the joint actions of the frictional
control and the centrifugal governor, the speed of rotation
can be continuously adjusted from 1 to 6 times. When the
adjusting screw is set in a particular position, the speed of
rotation, and therefore the rate of subsidence of plant-holder,
remains absolutely constant for several hours. The attainment
of this constancy is a matter of fundamental importance,
and it was only by the employment or the compound
system of regulation that I was able to secure it.</p>

<p>The method of obtaining balance now becomes extremely
simple. Before starting the balancing movement by clock
regulation, the plant is made to record its magnified growth
by the Crescograph. The compensation is effected as
follows: the speed of the clockwork is at the beginning
adjusted at its lowest value, and the pressure of a button<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
starts the balancing movement of the plant downwards. On
account of partial balance the record will be found to be
less steep than before; the speed of the clock is gradually
increased till the record becomes perfectly horizontal under
exact balance. Overbalance makes the record slope downwards.
In figure 95 is seen records of underbalance (<i>a</i>)
and overbalance (<i>b</i>), to the extent of about 3 per cent.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 640px;">
<img src="images/fig-095.jpg" width="593" height="480" alt="Fig. 95." title="" /><br />
<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 95.</span>&mdash;Balanced Crescographic record: (<i>a</i>) showing effect of underbalance
and (<i>b</i>) overbalance of about 3 per cent. (Magnification 2,000 times.)</p>
</div>


<p>It will thus be seen that the effect of an external agent
may be detected by the upsetting of the balance; an up-movement
indicates (unless stated to the contrary) an
enhancement of the rate of growth above the normal; and
a down-movement, on the other hand, a depression of the
normal rate.</p>

<p><i>Calibration.</i>&mdash;The calibration of the instrument is
obtained in two different ways. The rate of subsidence of
the plant-holder, by which the balance is obtained, is
strictly proportional to the rate of rotation of the vertical
spindle and the attached train of clock-wheels. A striker
is attached to one of the wheels, and a bell is struck
at each complete revolution. The clockwork is adjusted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
at a medium speed, the bell striking 35 times in a minute.
A microscope micrometer is focussed on a mark made on
the plant-holder, and the amount of subsidence of the
mark determined after one minute; this was found to be
0&middot;0525 mm. As this fall occurred after 35 strokes of the
bell the subsidence per stroke was 0&middot;0015 mm.</p>

<p><i>Determination of the absolute rate of growth.</i>&mdash;If growth
be found balanced at N strokes of bell per minute, the
rate of subsidence per second</p>

<p class="blockquot">
= N &times; <sup>&middot;0015</sup>&frasl;<sub>60</sub> mm. per second<br />
= N &times; &middot;000025 mm. per second<br />
= N &times; &middot;025 &micro; per second<br />
= N &times; 10<sup>-5</sup> inch per second.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Example.</i>&mdash;The growth of a specimen of <i>Zea Mays</i> was
found balanced when the number of strokes of the bell
was 20 times in a minute.</p>


<div class='center'>

<p>If we take the wave length of sodium light &#955; as our
standard, the growth in length per second is equal to &#955;.
This will give us some idea of the sensitiveness of
the Crescograph employed in recording the movement of
growth.</p>


<h4>GROWTH-SCALE.</h4>

<p>The Balanced Crescograph enables us not merely to
determine the absolute rate of growth, but the slightest
fluctuation in that rate.</p>

<p><i>Indicator Scale.</i>&mdash;All necessity of calculation is obviated
by the scale provided with the apparatus. The speed of
clockwork which brings about the balance of growth is
determined by the position of the adjusting screw S, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
gradual lowering of which produces a continuous diminution
of speed. A particular position of the screw therefore
indicates a definite rate of subsidence for balancing growth.
By a simple mechanism the up or down movement of the
screw causes rotation of an index pivoted at the centre of
a circular scale. Each division of the scale is calibrated
by counting the corresponding number of strokes of the
bell per minute at different positions of the adjusting screw.
The scale is calibrated in this manner to indicate different
rates of growth from 0&middot;2 &micro; to 1&middot;2 &micro; per second.</p>

<p>The determination of the rate of growth now becomes
extremely simple. Few turns of the screw bring about
the balance of growth and the resulting position of the
index against the circular scale automatically indicates the
absolute rate. The procedure is even simpler and more
expeditious than the determination of the weight of a
substance by means of a balance.</p>


<h4>SENSITIVENESS OF THE CRESCOGRAPHIC BALANCE.</h4>

<p>Perhaps the most delicate method of measuring lengths
is that afforded indirectly by the spectrum of a light. A
good spectroscope resolves differences of wave lengths of D<sub>1</sub>
(= 0&middot;5896 &micro;) and D<sub>2</sub> (= 0&middot;5890) <i>i.e.</i> of 1 part in a thousand.
The average rate of growth of <i>Zea Mays</i> is of this order;
being about 0&middot;5 &micro; per second. Let us consider the question
of the possibility of detecting a fractional variation of the
ultra-microscopic length by means of the Balanced Crescograph.
In reality the problem before us is more intricate
than simple measurement of change of length; for we have
to determine the <i>rate of variation</i> of length.</p>

<p>The sensitiveness of the balance will, it is obvious,
depend on the magnifying power of the Crescograph. By
the Method of Magnetic Amplification referred to in page
170, I have succeeded in obtaining a magnification of ten<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
million times. In this method a very delicate astatic
system of magnets undergoes deflection by the movement
of a magnetised lever in its neighbourhood. A spot of
light reflected from a small mirror attached to the astatic
system, thus gives the highly magnified movement of the
rate of growth, which may easily be raised to ten million
times. I shall in the following describe the results obtained
with this easily managed magnification of ten million
times.</p>

<p><i>Determination of sensitiveness: Experiment 99.</i>&mdash;A seedling
of <i>Zea Mays</i> was placed on the Crescographic Balance;
and the magnetic amplification, as stated above, was ten
million times. With 18 strokes of the bell per minute
the spot of light had a drift of + 266 cm. per minute to
the right; this is because the growth was underbalanced.
With faster rate of clock movement, <i>i.e.</i>, 21 strokes in 68
seconds or 18&middot;53 strokes per minute, the drift of the spot
of light, owing to overbalance, was to the left at the
rate of - 530 cm. per minute. Thus</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(1) 18 strokes per minute caused a drift of + 266
cm. per minute.</p>

<p>(2) 18&middot;53 strokes per minute caused a drift of - 530
cm. per minute.</p></div>

<p>Hence by interpolation the exact balance is found to
correspond to 18&middot;177 strokes per minute.</p>

<p>Therefore the absolute rate of growth</p>

<p class="blockquot">
= 18&middot;177 &times; 0&middot;025 &micro; per second.<br />
= 0&middot;45 &micro; per second.<br />
= 0&middot;000018 inch per second.<br />
</p>

<p>We learn further from (1) and (2) that a variation of
<sup>(18&middot;53 - 18)</sup>&frasl;<sub>18&middot;177</sub> produces a change of drift of the spot of light
from + 266 to - 530 cm., <i>i.e.</i>, of 796 cm. per minute.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
As it is easy to detect a drift of 1 cm. per minute a
variation of <sup>0&middot;53</sup>&frasl;<sub>(18&middot;177 &times; 796)</sub>,
or 1 part in 27,000 may thus be detected by the Method of Balance.
The spectroscopic method enabled us, as we saw, to detect change of wave
length 1 part in a thousand. The sensibility of the
Balanced Crescograph is thus seen to rival, if not surpass
that of the spectroscope.</p>

<p>For obtaining a general idea of the sensitiveness, the
absolute of growth in the instance given above was 0&middot;00018
inch per second, and the Balanced Crescograph was shown
capable of discriminating a variation of 1 part in 27,000;
hence it is possible to detect by this means a variation
of <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>1,500</sub> millionth of an inch per second.</p>

<p>This method of unprecedented delicacy opens out a new
field of investigation on the effect of changes of environment
in modification of growth; instances of this will be
found in subsequent chapters. I give below accounts of
certain demonstrations which will no doubt appear as very
striking.</p>

<p>After obtaining the exact balance a match was struck
in the neighbourhood of the plant. This produced a marked
movement of the hitherto quiescent spot of light, thus indicating
the perception of such an extremely feeble stimulus
by the plant.</p>

<p>Breathing on the plant causes an enhancement of growth
due to the joint effects of warmth and carbonic acid gas.
A more striking experiment is to fill a small jar with
carbonic acid and empty it over the plant. A violent movement
of the spot of light to the right demonstrates the stimulating
effect of this gas on growth.</p>

<p>The method described above is excessively sensitive; for
general purposes and for the method of direct record, a less<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
sensitive arrangement is sufficient. I give below accounts
of several typical experiments in which the recording form
of Crescograph was employed, the magnification being only
2,000 times.</p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 640px;">

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 96.</span>&mdash;Record showing the effect of CO<sub>2</sub>. Horizontal line at beginning
indicates balanced growth. Application of CO<sub>2</sub> at arrow induces enhancement
of growth shown by the up-curve followed by depression, shown by the down-curve.
Successive dots at intervals of 10 seconds. (Seedling of wheat.)</p>
</div>

<p><i>Effect of carbonic acid on Balanced growth: Experiment
100.</i>&mdash;I have already shown that carbonic acid diluted with
air induces an enhancement of the rate of growth, but its
long continued action induces a depression (p. 185). I
shall now employ the Method of Balance in studying the
effect of CO<sub>2</sub> on growth. It should be remembered in this
connection that the horizontal record indicates the balance
of normal rate of growth. An up-curve exhibits the
induced enhancement and a down-curve, a depression of
growth. In the present experiment after obtaining the exact
balance, pure carbonic acid gas was made to fill up the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
plant-chamber at the point marked with an arrow (Fig. 96).
It will be seen that this induced an almost immediate acceleration
of the rate, the latent period being less than five
seconds. The acceleration continued for two and half
minutes; the accelerated rate then slowed down, became
enfeebled, and the growth returned for a short time to the
normal as indicated by the horizontal portion at the top of
the record; this proved to be the turning point of
inversion from acceleration into retardation of growth. The
stronger is the concentration of the gas the earlier is the
point of inversion. With diluted carbonic acid the acceleration
may persist for an hour or more.</p>


<h4>EFFECT OF AN&AElig;STHETICS.</h4>

<p><i>Effect of Ether: Experiment 101.</i>&mdash;Dilute vapour  of
ether is found to induce an acceleration of rate of growth
which persist for a considerable length of time. This is
seen in the upsetting of the balance upwards on the
introduction of the vapour (Fig. 97a.).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 640px;">

</div>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Effect of Chloroform: Experiment 102.</i>&mdash;The effect of
chloroform vapour is relatively more depressing than
ether. Application of chloroform is seen to induce at
first an acceleration which persisted for 50 seconds, but
after this depression set in (Fig. 97b). Prolonged application
of the an&aelig;sthetic is followed by the death of the
plant.</p>


<h4>SUMMARY.</h4>

<p>In the Method of Balance the movement of growth
upwards is compensated by an equal movement of the
plant downwards, with the result that the record remains
horizontal.</p>

<p>The effect of an external agent is immediately detected
by the upsetting of the balance, up-record representing
acceleration above normal, a down-record the opposite
effect of depression below the normal rate.</p>

<p>The latent period and the after-effect of stimulus may
thus be obtained with the highest accuracy.</p>

<p>The sensitiveness of the Method of Balance may be
raised so as to indicate a variation of rate of growth
smaller than <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>1000</sub> millionth of an inch per second.</p>

<h2><a name="XXIII_ON_TROPIC_MOVEMENTS" id="XXIII_ON_TROPIC_MOVEMENTS"></a>XXIII.&mdash;ON TROPIC MOVEMENTS</h2>

<h3><i>By</i><br />

<br /><span class="smcap">Sir J. C. Bose.</span></h3>


<p>The diverse movements induced by external stimuli in
different organs of plants are extremely varied and complicated.
The forces in operation are manifold&mdash;the
influence of changing temperature, the stimulus of contact,
of electric current, of gravity, and of light visible and
invisible. They act on organs which exhibit all degrees
of physiological differentiation, from the radial to the
dorsiventral. An identical stimulus may sometimes induce
one effect, and at other times, the precisely opposite. Thus
under unilateral stimulation of light of increasing intensity,
a radial organ exhibits a positive, a dia-phototropic,
and finally a negative response. Strong sunlight brings
about para-heliotropic or 'midday sleep' movement, by which
the apices of leaves or leaflets turn towards or away from
the source of illumination. The teleological argument advanced,
that in this position the plant is protected from
excessive transpiration, does not hold good universally; for
under the same reaction, the leaflets of <i>Cassia montana</i>
assume positions by which the plant risks fatal loss of
water. In <i>Averrhoa carambola</i> the movement is downwards,
whichever side is illuminated with strong light;
in <i>Mimosa</i> leaflet the movement, under similar circumstances
is precisely in the opposite direction. The photonastic
movement, apparently independent of the directive
action of light, has come to be regarded as a phenomenon
unrelated to phototropic reaction, and due to a different<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
kind of irritability, and a different mode of response. So
very anomalous are these various effects that Pfeffer, after
showing the inadequacy of different theories that have been
advanced, came to the conclusion that "the precise character
of the stimulatory action of light has yet to be determined.
When we say that an organ curves towards a source
of illumination because of its heliotropic irritability, we are
simply expressing an ascertained fact in a conveniently
abbreviated form, without explaining why such curvature
is possible or how it is produced."<a name="FNanchor_A_2" id="FNanchor_A_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>The contradictory nature of the various responses is
however not real; the apparent anomaly had lain in the
fact that two definite fundamental reactions of opposite
signs induced by stimulus had not hitherto been recognised
and distinguished from each other. The innumerable variations
in the resultant response are due to the summation of
the effects of two fluctuating factors, with further complications
arising from: (1) difference in the point of application of
stimulus, (2) the differential excitability of the different sides
of the responding organ, and (3) the effect of temperature
in modifying tropic curvature. It is therefore most important
to have the means for automatic record of <i>continuous</i>
change in the response brought about by various factors,
which act sometimes in accord, and at other times in conflict.
The autograph of the plant itself, giving a history of
the change in response and its time-relations, is alone
decisive in explanation of various difficulties in connection
with plant movements, as against the various tentative
theories that have been put forward.  The analysis of the
resulting effect, thus rendered possible, casts new light on
the phenomena of response, proving that the anomalies
which had so long perplexed us, are more apparent than
real.</p>

<p>One of the causes of uncertainty lay with the question,
whether response changed with the mode of stimulation. I
have, however, been able to show that <i>all forms of stimuli</i>
induce a definite excitatory reaction of contraction (p. 218).</p>

<p>Tropic movements induced by unilateral action of
stimulus may, broadly speaking, be divided into two classes
depending on the point of application of stimulus:</p>

<p>In the first, the point of application of unilateral
stimulus is not on the responding organ itself, but at
some distance from it. The question therefore relates to
<span class="smcap">Longitudinal Transmission</span> of effect of stimulus.</p>

<p>In the second, unilateral stimulus acts directly on the
responding organ. For the determination of the resultant
movement, it is necessary to take account of effects
induced on the two sides of the organ. The side adjacent
to the stimulus I shall designate as the <i>proximal</i>, and
the diametrically opposite as the <i>distal</i> side. The question
to be investigated in this case relates to <span class="smcap">Transverse
Transmission</span> of effect of stimulus. It will be shown that
the resulting movement depends on:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(<i>a</i>) whether the tissue is a conductor or a non-conductor
of excitation in a transverse direction,
and</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) whether it is the proximal, or the distal side of
the organ that is the more excitable.</p></div>

<p>In connection with the response to environmental
changes, a source of uncertainty is traceable to the absence
of sufficient knowledge of the physiological effect of heat,
which has been regarded as a form of stimulus: it will
be shown that heat induces two distinct effects dependent
on conduction and radiation. We shall in the succeeding
chapters, take up the study of the physiological effects
induced by changes in the environment.</p>

TRANSMISSION OF EFFECT OF STIMULUS</h2>

<p>I have in previous chapters explained that the direct
application of stimulus gives rise in different organs to
contraction, diminution of turgor, fall of motile leaf, electro-motive
change of galvanometric negativity, and retardation
of the rate of growth. I have also shown that
indirect stimulation (<i>i.e.</i> application of stimulus at some
distance from the responding organ) gives rise to a positive
or erectile response of the responding leaf or leaflet
(indicative of an increase of turgor), often followed by
normal negative response. The positive impulse travels
quickly. The interval of time that elapses, between the
application of stimulus and the erectile response of the
responding leaf, depends on the distance of the point of
application, and the character of the transmitting tissue:
it varies in different cases from 0&middot;6 second to about 40
seconds. The positive is followed by a slower wave of
protoplasmic excitation, which causes the excitatory fall.
The velocity of this excitatory impulse is about 30 mm.
per second in the petiole of <i>Mimosa</i>, and about 3 mm.
per second in <i>Biophytum</i>. The positive followed by the
negative thus gives rise to a diphasic response. The
excitatory impulse is much enfeebled during transit: the
negative impulse may thus fail to reach the responding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
organ, if the stimulus be feeble or if the intervening distance
be long or semi-conducting. Hence moderate stimulus
applied at a distance gives rise only to positive response;
direct application of strong stimulus gives rise, on the
other hand, to the normal negative. By employing the
electric method of investigation, I have obtained with
ordinary tissues the positive, the diphasic, and the negative
electric response, in correspondence with the responses
given by a motile organ (p. 214). The mechanics of
propagation of the positive and the negative impulse are
different. It is therefore necessary to distinguish the
quick <i>transmission</i> of the positive impulse from the slow
<i>conduction</i> of the negative impulse due to the propagation
of excitatory protoplasmic change.</p>

<p>It should be borne in mind in this connection that all
responsive movements are ultimately due to protoplasmic
changes which are beyond our scrutiny. We can infer the
nature of the change by the concomitant outward manifestations,
which are of two kinds: the <i>positive</i>, associated
with increase of turgor, expansion, and galvanometric positivity,
and the <i>negative</i> with concomitant decrease of turgor,
contraction, and galvanometric negativity. Thus positive
and negative reactions indicate the fundamental protoplasmic
changes of opposite characters.</p>

<p>The movement and curvature induced by stimulus
have, for convenience, been distinguished as <i>positive curvature</i>,
(movement towards stimulus), and <i>negative curvature</i>
(movement away from stimulus). Though these curvatures
result from protoplasmic reactions, yet the <i>positive curvature</i>
is not necessarily associated with <i>positive protoplasmic
reaction</i>. It will be shown that the curvature of an organ
is determined by the algebraical summation of effects
induced at the proximal and distal sides of the responding
organ.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span></p>

<p>Physiologists have not been aware of the dual character
of the impulse generated by stimulus, and the term "transmission
of stimulus" is thus misleading since its effect
may be an expansion, or its very opposite, contraction.
It is therefore necessary to discriminate the effect of one
from the other: the impulse which induces an increase
of turgor, expansion, and galvanometric positivity will be
distinguished as positive, in the sense that it causes an
enhancement of turgor. The other, which induces diminution
of turgor and contraction, will be termed as the excitatory
impulse. Transmission of the latter is dependent on
conducting power of the tissue; the positive impulse is
practically independent of the conducting power.</p>

<p>In animal physiology again, there is no essential
difference between the effect of the direct and indirect
stimulation. In a nerve-and-muscle preparation, for example,
indirect stimulation at the nerve induces the same
contraction as the direct stimulation of the muscle. The
only difference lies in the latent period, which is found
to be longer under indirect stimulation by the time
interval necessary for the excitation to travel along the
conducting nerve. It is probable that stimulus gives rise
to dual impulses in the animal tissue as in the plant.
But the detection of the positive impulse in the animal
nerve is rendered exceedingly difficult on account of the
high velocity of conduction of excitation. I have explained
that the separate effects of the two impulses can only be
detected if there is a sufficient lag of the excitatory
negative behind the positive, so that the relatively sluggish
responding organ may exhibit the two impulses one
after the other. In a highly conducting tissue the lag is
very slight, and the negative will therefore mask the
positive by its predominant effect. In spite of the difficulty
involved in the problem, I have recently been successful in
demonstrating the dual impulses in the animal nerve.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span></p>

<p>In any case it is important to remember the following
characteristic effects of indirect stimulation.</p>

direct and indirect stimulation, we shall next study the
tropic effects induced in growing organs by the effect of
unilateral application of indirect stimulus.</p>

<p><i>Experiment 103.</i>&mdash;I have already explained, how thermal
<i>radiation</i> is almost as effective in inducing contraction
and retardation of growth as the more refrangible rays
of the spectrum. The thermal radiation was produced by
the heating of a platinum spiral, short of incandescence,
by the passage of an electric current. The intensity of
radiation is easily varied by adjustment of the current by
means of a rheostat. The experimental specimen was a
flower bud of <i>Crinum</i>. It was held by a clamp, a little
below the region of growth. Stimulus was applied below
the clamp so that the transmitted effect had to pass
through S, the securely held tissue (Fig. 98). A feeble
stimulus was applied on one side, at the indifferent
point about 3 cm. below the region of growth. The
positive effect of indirect stimulus reached the region
of growth on the same side, bringing about an acceleration
of growth with expansion and convexity, the resulting
movement being <i>negative</i> or away from the stimulus. The
latent period was ten seconds, and maximum negative
movement was completed in the further course of ten
seconds, after which there was a recovery in the course
of 75 seconds. A stronger stimulus S' gave a larger
response; but when the intensity was raised still higher to
S", the excitatory negative impulse overtook the positive
within 15 seconds of its commencement; the convex was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
thus succeeded by the concave curvature (Fig. 99). Direct
application of stimulus at the growing region gave rise
to a positive curvature.</p>

(movement away from the stimulated side); stronger stimulus S" gave rise to
negative followed by positive. Successive dots at intervals of 5 seconds Magnification
100 times.</p>
</div>


<p>The effect of feeble stimulus transmitted longitudinally
is thus found always to induce convexity, a <i>negative
curvature</i> and movement away from stimulus. I
have obtained similar responsive movement of negative
sign with various plant organs, and under various forms
of stimuli. Thus in the stem of <i>Dregea volubilis</i> the
longitudinally transmitted effect of light of moderate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
intensity was a negative curvature; direct application of
light on the growing region gave, on the other hand, a
positive curvature and movement towards light.</p>

<p>Thus while the effect of direct unilateral stimulation
is a positive curvature, the effect of indirect stimulation
is a negative curvature. The following table gives a
summary of results of tropic effects under unilateral
application of indirect stimulus.</p>

<h4>SUMMARY.</h4>

<p>In sensitive plants stimulus applied at a distance
induces in the responding region an expansion indicative
of increase of turgor.</p>

<p>The effect of indirect stimulation is also exhibited by
an electric change of galvanometric positivity, indicative of
enhancement of turgor and expansion.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span></p>

<p>Indirect stimulus induces in growing organs an enhancement
of rate of growth.</p>

<p>Unilateral application of stimulus causes an expansion
higher up on the same side to which the stimulus is
applied; the result is an induced convexity, a movement
away from the stimulus, <i>i.e.</i>, a negative curvature. Direct
stimulus applied unilaterally at the responding region
induces, on the other hand, a positive curvature.</p>

<p>We have next to consider a very large class of phenomena
arising out of the direct stimulation of one side and
its transversely transmitted effect on the opposite side.
The unilateral stimuli to which the plant is naturally exposed
are those of contact, of light, of thermal radiation,
and of gravity. There is besides the stimulation by electric
current. I shall presently show that these tropic
curvatures are determined by the definite effects of direct
and indirect stimulations.</p>

<p>Under unilateral stimulus, the proximal side is found
to become concave and the distal side convex; the organ
thus moves towards stimulus, exhibiting a positive curvature.
This movement may be due: (1) to the diminution
of turgor, contraction or retardation of rate of growth of
the proximal side, (2) to the increase of turgor, expansion
or acceleration of rate of growth on the distal side,
or (3) to the joint effects of contraction of the proximal
and expansion of the distal side.</p>

<p>As regards the reaction of the proximal side, it has
been shown that direct stimulation induces local contraction
in a pulvinated organ, and retardation of growth in
a growing organ. The effect induced on the distal side<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
had hitherto remained a matter of uncertainty. In regard
to this we must bear in mind that it is the effect of
indirect stimulus that reaches the distal sided, inducing an
enhancement of turgor and expansion of that side.</p>

<p>For obtaining a complete explanation of tropic curvatures
in general, it is important that the induction of enhanced
turgor at the distal side (by the action of stimulus
at the proximal side) should be corroborated by independent
methods of enquiry. One of the methods I employed
for this purpose was electrical. Two electric connections
were made, one with the distal point (diametrically opposite
to the stimulated area), and the other, with an indifferent
point at a distance. On application of stimulus of
various kinds, the distal point was found to exhibit galvanometric
positivity, indicative of enhancement of turgor.<a name="FNanchor_A_3" id="FNanchor_A_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>I have since been able to devise a new experiment by
which the enhancement of turgor on the distal side is
demonstrated in a very striking manner.</p>

<p>I have shown (p. 39) that the movement of the
motile leaf of <i>Mimosa</i> is a reliable indicator of the state of
turgor, increase of turgor inducing erection, and diminution
of turgor bringing about the fall of the leaf. I shall
employ the mechanical response of the leaf to demonstrate
the enhancement of turgor induced by transverse transmission
of effect of stimulus.</p>

<h4>TURGOR-VARIATION UNDER  TRANSVERSE TRANSMISSION
OF STIMULUS-EFFECT.</h4>

<p><i>Unilateral photic stimulation: Experiment 104.</i>&mdash;A <i>Mimosa</i>
plant was taken, and its stem was held vertical by means
of a clamp. We apply a stimulus at a point on one side
of the stem, and observe the effect of this on the state
of turgor at the diametrically opposite side. In my first
experiment on the subject of detection of induced change
of turgor I employed the stimulus of light. A narrow
beam from a small arc lamp was made to fall on the
stem, at a point diametrically opposite to the motile leaf,
which was to serve as a indicator for induced variation
of turgor at the distal side. The leaf was attached to the
recording lever, the successive dots in the record being at
intervals of ten seconds. Stimulation by light caused a
positive or erectile movement within 20 seconds of application.
The positive response afforded a conclusive proof of
the induction of an increase of turgor at the distal point.
When the stimulus is moderate or of short duration, the
response remains positive. But with strong or prolonged
stimulation, the slower excitatory negative impulse is conducted
to the distal point and brings about the sudden fall
of the leaf (Fig. 100). In the present case the excitatory
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>impulse reached the motile organ 200 seconds after the
initiation of the positive response. The stem was thin,
only 2 mm. in diameter. The velocity of excitatory
impulse in a transverse direction is thus 0&middot;01 mm. per
second; transverse transmission is, for obvious reasons, a
much slower process than longitudinal transmission of excitation;
in the <i>Mimosa</i> stem this is about 4 mm. per second.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 101.</span>&mdash;Response of leaf of <i>Mimosa</i> under transverse transmission of
electric stimulus. (Compare this with fig. 100.)</p>
</div>


<p><i>Unilateral electric stimulation: Experiment 105.</i>&mdash;In
order to show that the effects described above are not due
to any particular mode of stimulation but to stimuli in
general, I carried out an additional experiment, the
stimulus employed being electrical. Two fine pin-electrodes
were pricked into the stem, opposite to the responding
leaf of <i>Mimosa</i>; these electrodes were placed vertically
one above the other, 5 mm. apart. After a suitable
period, allowed for recovery from mechanical irritation,
feeble tetanising electric shock was passed through the
electrodes. The responsive effects at the distal side of the
stem is precisely similar to those induced under unilateral
photic stimulation; that is to say, the first effect was
an erectile movement of the leaf, indicative of an induced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
enhancement of turgor; the excitatory negative impulse
then reached the distal point and caused a sudden fall of
the leaf (Fig. 101).</p>

<p>The experiments that have just been described are of
much significance. An organ like the stem of <i>Mimosa</i>,
since it exhibits no contraction, may appear insensitive
to stimulation; but its perception of stimulus is
shown by its power of transmitting two characteristic
impulses, one of which is the positive, giving rise to an
enhancement of turgor, and the other, the true excitatory
negative, inducing the opposite reaction or diminution of
turgor. Unilateral stimulation gives rise to both these
effects in all organs: pulvinated, growing, and non-growing.
It was the fortunate circumstance of the insertion of the
motile leaf on one side of the <i>Mimosa</i> stem that enabled
us to demonstrate the important facts given above.</p>

<p>The underlying reactions, which give rise to tropic
curvature, could have been foretold from the Laws of
effects of Direct and Indirect stimulation, established in
previous chapters (pp. 136, 216). The resulting curvature
is thus brought about by the joint effects of direct stimulation
of the proximal, and indirect stimulation of
the distal side. We may now recapitulate some of the
important facts relating to tropic curvatures:</p>

<p>Indirect stimulation gives rise to dual impulses, positive
and negative; of these the positive impulse is practically
independent of the conducting power of the tissue; but
the transmission of the excitatory negative impulse is
dependent on the conducting power. No tissue is a perfect
conductor, nor is any a perfect non-conductor of excitation,
the difference is a question of degree. In a petiole or a
stem the conducting power along the direction of length is
considerable, but very feeble in a transverse direction. In
a semi-conducting tissue, a feeble stimulus will transmit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
only the positive impulse; strong or long continued stimulation
will transmit both positive and negative impulses,
the positive preceding the negative. The transmitted positive
gives rise to increase of turgor, expansion, and acceleration
of rate of growth; the negative induces the opposite
reaction of diminution of turgor, of contraction, and of
retardation of rate of growth. Transverse transmission is
only a particular instance of transmission in general;
the only difference is that the conducting power for
<i>excitation</i> is very much less in the transverse than in
the longitudinal direction. Owing to feeble transverse
conductivity, the transmitted impulse to the distal side
often remains positive; it is only under strong or continued
stimulation that the excitatory negative reaches the
distal side and neutralises or reverses the previous positive
reaction. If the distal is the more excitable side, the
reversed response will appear as pronounced negative.
I give a table which will clearly exhibit the effects
of stimulus on the proximal and distal sides of the
responding organ.</p>

<p>It will thus be seen that the tropic effect is modified by:</p>

<p>(2) the intensity and duration of stimulus,</p>

<p>In the following series of Papers the tropic effects of

<h4>SUMMARY.</h4>

<p>In a semi-conducting tissue Direct stimulation induces
a diminution of turgor and contraction, Indirect stimulation
inducing the opposite effect of increase of turgor and
expansion.</p>

<p>Unilateral stimulation thus induces a positive curvature
by the joint effects of contraction at the proximal, and
expansion at the distal side.</p>

<p>Under strong and long continued unilateral stimulation,
the excitation at the proximal side is transmitted to
the distal side. Transverse conduction thus neutralises or
reverses the normal positive curvature.</p>

<p>In response to the stimulus of contact a tendril twines
round its support. Certain tendrils are uniformly sensitive
on all sides; but in other cases, as in the tendril of
<i>Passiflora</i>, the sensitiveness is greater on the under side.
A curvature is induced when this side is rubbed with a
splinter of wood, the stimulated under side becoming
concave. This movement may be distinguished as a movement
of <i>curling</i>. There is, as I shall presently show, a
response where the under side becomes convex, and the
curvature becomes reversed.</p>

<p>As regards perception of mechanical stimulus, Pfeffer
discovered tactile pits in the tendrils <i>Cucurbitace&aelig;</i>. These
pits no doubt facilitate sudden deformation of the sensitive
protoplasm by frictional contact. No satisfactory explanation
has however been offered as regards the physiological
machinery of responsive movement. The difficulty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
of explanation of twining movements is accentuated by a
peculiarity in the response of tendrils which is extremely
puzzling. This anomaly was observed by Fitting in tendrils
which are sensitive on the under side:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"If a small part of the upper side and at the same
time the whole of the under side be stimulated, curvature
takes place only at the places on the under side which lie
opposite to the unstimulated regions of the upper side. The
<i>sensitiveness</i> to contact is thus as well developed on the
upper side as on the under side, and the difference between
the two sides lies in the fact that while stimulation of the
under side induces curvature, stimulation of the upper side
induces <i>no visible result</i>, or simply inhibits curvature on
the under side, according to circumstances."<a name="FNanchor_A_4" id="FNanchor_A_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p></div>

<p>Here then we have the inexplicable phenomenon of a
particular tissue, itself incapable of response, yet arresting
the movement in a neighbouring tissue.</p>

<p>The problem before us may be thus stated: Is the movement
of the tendril due to certain specific sensibility of the
organ, on account of which its reactions are characteristically
different from other tropic movements? Or, does the twining
of tendril come under the law of tropic curvature that has
been established, namely that it is brought about by the
contraction of the directly stimulated proximal side, and the
expansion of the indirectly stimulated distal side?</p>

<p>I shall now describe my investigations on the effects of
direct and indirect stimulus on the growth of tendril; I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
have in this investigation studied the effect not merely of
mechanical, but also of other forms of stimuli. I shall also
describe the diverse effects induced by mechanical stimulus
under different conditions. From the results of these experiments
I shall be able to show that the twining of the tendril
comes under the general law of tropic curvature; that
the curvature results from the contraction of the proximal
and expansion of the distal side. Finally I shall be able
to offer a satisfactory explanation of the inhibition of
response of the tendril by the stimulation of the opposite
side of the organ.</p>


<h4>GENERAL EFFECTS OF INDIRECT AND DIRECT ELECTRIC
STIMULATION ON THE GROWTH OF TENDRIL.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 102.</span>&mdash;Diagrammatic
representation of indirect
and direct stimulation of
tendril.</p>
</div>

<p>For this experiment I took a growing tendril of
<i>Cucurbita</i> in which the sensitiveness is
more or less uniform on all sides. The
tendril was suitably mounted on the
Balanced Crescograph, which records the
variation of the rate of growth induced
by immediate and after-effect of
stimulus. The specimen is held in a
clamp as in the diagram (Fig. 102),
the tip being suitably attached to the
recording lever. For indirect stimulation
feeble shock from an induction coil is
applied at the two electric connections
below the clamp. Direct stimulus is
applied by means of electric connections
one above and the other below the
clamp.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 103.</span>&mdash;Record by Method
of Balance, showing acceleration
of growth of tendril (up-curve)
induced by indirect stimulation.
(<i>Cucurbita.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p><i>Effect of Indirect Stimulus: Experiment 106.</i>&mdash;The
growth of the tendril was exactly
balanced, and the record became
horizontal. Indirect stimulus was
next applied below the clamp; this
is seen to upset the balance, with
the resulting up-curve which
indicates a sudden acceleration of
growth above the normal. This
acceleration took place within ten
seconds of the application of
stimulus, and persisted for three
minutes; after this the normal rate
of growth became restored, as seen
by the balanced record once more
becoming horizontal (Fig. 103).</p>

<p><i>Effect of Direct Stimulus: Experiment 107.</i>&mdash;The incipient
contraction induced by direct stimulation is so
great that the record obtained by the delicate method of
balance cannot be kept within the plate. I, therefore,
took the ordinary growth-curve on a moving plate. The
first part of the curve represents normal growth; stimulus
of feeble electric shock was applied at the highest point of
the curve. This is seen (Fig. 104) to induce an immediate
contraction and reversal of the curve which persisted for
two and half minutes, after which growth was slowly
renewed. The most interesting fact regarding the after-effect
of stimulus is that the rate of growth became actually
enhanced to three times the normal. This is clearly seen
in the record (upper half of the figure) taken 20 minutes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
after stimulation, where the curve is far more erect than
that of the normal rate of growth before stimulation.</p>

</div>

<p>The effects of Indirect and Direct stimulation of the
tendril are summarised below:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(1) Indirect stimulation induces a sudden enhancement
of rate of growth, followed by a recovery of the
normal rate.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span></p>
<p>(2) Direct stimulation induces a retardation of the rate
of growth which may culminate into an actual
contraction. <i>The after-effect of direct stimulus of
moderate intensity is an enhancement of the rate
of growth.</i></p></div>

<p>The experiments described above demonstrate the effects
of direct and indirect electrical stimulus. I shall now
proceed to show that mechanical stimulus induces effects
which are similar to those of electric stimulus.</p>


<h4>EFFECTS OF DIRECT AND INDIRECT MECHANICAL
STIMULUS.</h4>

<p><i>Effect of Direct mechanical stimulus: Experiment 108.</i>&mdash;In
this case I took a tendril of <i>Cucurbita</i>, and attached
it to the ordinary High Magnification Crescograph, the
record of which gives the absolute rate of its normal
growth, and the induced variation of that rate. The tendril
was stimulated mechanically by simultaneous friction of its
different sides. The immediate effect was a retardation of
growth, the reduced rate being less than half the normal.
There was a recovery on the cessation of the stimulus; the
rate of growth was even slightly enhanced after an interval
of 15 minutes. Table XXVI shows the immediate and
after-effects of mechanical stimulation on growth.</p>

<p class="tabcap">TABLE XXVI.&mdash;SHOWING THE IMMEDIATE AND AFTER-EFFECT OF MECHANICAL
STIMULATION ON TENDRIL (<i>Cucurbita</i>).</p>

<p>The immediate and after-effects of mechanical stimulus
on the tendril are therefore the same as that of electric
stimulus. The incipient contraction under direct mechanical
stimulus, moreover, is not the special characteristic of
tendrils, but of growing plants in general. For I have
shown (page 203) that the growth of flower stalk of
<i>Zephyranthes</i> is also retarded after mechanical friction,
from the normal rate 0&middot;48 &micro; to 0&middot;11 &micro; after stimulation. We
shall find later that different plant organs, after moderate
stimulation, exhibit acceleration of growth as an after-effect.
The phenomenon of responsive reaction of tendril
is therefore not unique, but similar to that of other organs
under all forms of stimulation. The only speciality in
tendril is that owing to anatomical peculiarities, the perceptive
power of the organ for mechanical stimulus is highly
developed.</p>

<p>We are now in a position to offer an explanation of
the induced concavity of the stimulated side of the tendril,
and its recovery after brief contact. The experiments that
have been described show that:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(1) the proximal side contracts because it is directly
stimulated, and the distal side, being indirectly
stimulated, expands; the curvature is thus due to
the joint effects of contraction of one side, and
expansion of the opposite side, and</p>

<p>(2) the recovery of the tendril after brief contact is
hastened by the after-effect of stimulus, which
is expansion and acceleration of growth.</p></div>

<p>The results given above will also be found to explain
Fitting's important observations<a name="FNanchor_A_5" id="FNanchor_A_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> that (<i>a</i>) the stimulated
side of the tendril undergoes transient contraction with
subsequent acceleration of growth, and that (<i>b</i>) the distal
or convex side undergoes an immediate enhancement of
growth.</p>

</div>

<p>I give below a record given by a tendril of <i>Cucurbita</i>
in response to unilateral contact of short duration (Fig. 105).
Successive dots in the record are at intervals of three
seconds. The latent period was ten seconds, and the maximum
curvature was attained in the course of two and a
half minutes. The curvature persisted for a further period
of two minutes after which recovery was completed in the
course of 12 minutes. Feeble stimulation is attended by
a recovery within a short period, but under strong stimulus
the induced curvature becomes more persistent.</p>


<h4>INHIBITORY ACTION OF STIMULUS.</h4>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 440px;">
<img src="images/fig-106.jpg" width="225" height="425" alt="Fig. 106." title="" /><br />
<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 106.</span>&mdash;Diagrammatic representation
of effects of Indirect
and Direct unilateral
stimulation of the tendril.
Indirect stimulation, I, induces
movement away from stimulated
side (negative curvature) represented
by continuous arrow.
Direct stimulation, D, induces
movement towards stimulus
(positive curvature) indicated
by dotted arrow.</p>
</div>

<p>I have referred to the remarkable observation of Fitting
that though the application of stimulus on the upper side
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>of the tendril of <i>Passiflora</i> did not induce any response,
yet it inhibited the normal response of the under side.</p>

<p>The results of experiments which I have described will,
however, afford a satisfactory explanation
of this curious inhibition.
It has been explained, that the
curvature of the tendril is due to
the joint effects of diminished
turgor and contraction at the
directly stimulated side, and an
enhancement of turgor and expansion
on the opposite side. In
the diagram seen in figure 106,
the left is the more excitable side,
and contraction will induce concavity
of the stimulated side. But
if the opposite or less excitable side
of the tendril be stimulated at the
same time, then the transmitted
effect of indirect stimulus will
induce enhancement of turgor and
expansion on the left side, and
thus neutralise the previous effect
of direct stimulus. An inhibition
of response will thus result from
the stimulation of the opposite
side.</p>


<p>A difficulty arises here from the fact that the upper
side of the tendril (the right side in Fig. 106) is supposed
to be inexcitable and non-contractile. Hence there may be
a misgiving that the stimulation of the non-motile side
may not induce the effect of indirect stimulus (an
increase of turgor and expansion) at the opposite side,
which is to inhibit the response. But I have shown that
even a non-contractile organ under stimulus generates both<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
the impulses, positive and negative. This is seen illustrated
in figure 100, where the rigid stem of <i>Mimosa</i> was subjected
to unilateral stimulation; the effect of indirect stimulus was
found to induce an enhancement of turgor at the diametrically
opposite side, and thus caused an erectile movement of
the motile leaf. Electric investigations which I have carried
out also corroborate the results given above. Here also
stimulation of a non-motile organ at any point, induces
at a diametrically opposite point, a positive electric variation
indicative of enhanced turgor. It will thus be seen
that inhibition is possible even in the absence of contraction
of the upper side of the tendril; hence the contraction of
the directly stimulated side is neutralised by the effect of
indirect stimulation of the distal side.</p>


<h4>RESPONSE OF LESS EXCITABLE SIDE OF THE TENDRIL.</h4>

<p>It is generally supposed that the upper side of the
tendril of <i>Passiflora</i> is devoid of contractility. This is however
not the case, for my experiments show that stimulation
of the upper side also induces contraction and concavity
of that side, though the actual movement is relatively
feeble.</p>

<p><i>Experiment 109.</i>&mdash;In order to subject the question to
quantitative test I applied feeble stimulus of the same
intensity on upper and lower side alternately. Successive
stimuli were kept more or less uniform by employing the
following device. I took a flat strip of wood 1 cm. in
breadth, and coated 2 cm. of its length with shellac varnish
mixed with fine emery powder. On drying the surface
became rough, the flat surface was gently pressed against
the area of the tendril to be stimulated, and quickly
drawn so that the rough surface 2 cm.&times;1 cm. was rubbed
against the tendril in each experiment. Stimulation, thus
produced, induced a responsive movement of each side of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
the organ. The extent of the maximum movement was
measured by the microscope micrometer. The following
results were obtained with four different specimens.</p>

</table></div>

<p>It will thus be seen that the upper side of the tendril
is not totally inexcitable, its power of contraction being
about one-seventh that of the under side.</p>


<h4>NEGATIVE CURVATURE OF THE TENDRIL.</h4>

<p>I shall now describe certain remarkable results which
show that under certain definite conditions the tendril
moves away from the stimulated side. I have explained,
how in growing organs the effect of unilateral stimulus
longitudinally transmitted, induces an expansion higher up
on the same side to which the stimulus is applied, resulting
in convexity and movement away from the stimulus
(cf. Laws of Tropic Curvatures, p. 286). As the reaction of
tendril is in no way different from that of growing
organs in general, it occurred to me that it would be
possible to induce in it a negative curvature by application
of indirect unilateral stimulus.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Experiment 110.</i>&mdash;A tendril of <i>Passiflora</i> was held in
a clamp, as in the diagram (Fig. 106) in which the left
is the more excitable side of the organ. The responsive
movement of the tendril is observed by focussing a reading
microscope on a mark on the upper part of the
tendril. Direct mechanical stimulation at the dotted
arrow makes the tendril move in the same direction, the
response being <i>positive</i>. But if stimulus be applied on
the same side below the clamp the tendril is found to
move away from stimulus, the response being now
<i>negative</i>. This reversal of response, as previously stated,
is due to the fact that the transmitted effect of indirect
stimulus induces an acceleration of growth higher up on the
same side, which now becomes convex. The result though
unexpected, is in every way parallel to the response of the
flower bud of <i>Crinum</i>, in which the normal positive response
was converted into negative by changing the point
of application of stimulus, so that it became indirect (p.
216).</p>


<h4>SUMMARY.</h4>

<p>The response of tendril is in no way different from
that of growing organs in general.</p>

<p>Direct stimulus, electrical or mechanical, induces an incipient
contraction; the after-effect of a feeble stimulus is an
acceleration of growth above the normal. Indirect stimulus
induces an enhancement of the rate of growth.</p>

<p>Under unilateral mechanical stimulus of short duration
the directly excited proximal side undergoes contraction,
the indirectly stimulated distal side exhibits the opposite
effect of expansion. The induced curvature is thus due
to the joint effects of the contraction of one side, and the
expansion of the opposite side.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span></p>

<p>As the after-effect of direct stimulus is an acceleration of
growth above the normal, the stimulated side undergoes an
expansion by which the recovery is hastened.</p>

<p>Unilateral application of direct stimulus induces a <i>positive</i>
curvature, but the same stimulus applied at a
distance from the responding region induces a <i>negative</i>
curvature.</p>

<p>The tendril of <i>Passiflora</i> is excitable both on the upper
and under sides: the excitability of the under side is
about seven times greater than that of the upper side.</p>

<p>Stimulation of one side of the tendril induces an expansion
of the opposite side, even in cases where the contractility
of the stimulated side is feeble.</p>

<p>The response to stimulation of the more excitable side
of the tendril is thus inhibited by the stimulation of the
opposite side. This is because of the neutralisation of the
effect of direct by that of indirect stimulation.</p>

<p>Before describing the effect of unilateral application
of an electrical current in inducing tropic curvature, I
shall give an account of the polar effect of anode and
cathode on the pulvinated and growing organs. In my
previous work<a name="FNanchor_A_6" id="FNanchor_A_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> on the action of electrical current on
sensitive pulvini I have shown that:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(1) at the 'make' of a current of moderate intensity
a contraction takes place at the cathode; the
anode induces no such contractile effect;</p>

<p>(2) at the 'make' of a stronger current both the
anode and cathode induce contraction.</p></div>

<p>I have also carried out further investigations on the
polar effect of current on the autonomous activity of the
leaflet of <i>Desmodium gyrans</i>. These rhythmic pulsations
can be recorded by my Oscillating Recorder. Each pulsation
consists of a sudden contractile movement downwards,
corresponding to the systole of a beating heart, and a
slower up movement of diastolic expansion. Application of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
cathode at the pulvinule was found to exert a <i>contractile</i>
reaction, exhibited either by the reduction of normal limit
of diastolic expansion, or by an arrest of movement at
systole. The effect of anode was precisely the opposite;
the induced <i>expansion</i> was exhibited either by reduction
of normal limit of systolic contraction, or by arrest of
pulsation at diastole.</p>

<p>From the above results it is seen that with a feeble
current:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(1) contraction is induced at the cathode, and</p>

<p>(2) expansion is brought about at the anode.</p></div>

<p>These effects take place under the action of a feeble
current. Under strong currents, contraction takes place
both at the anode and the cathode.</p>


<h4>POLAR EFFECT OF ELECTRICAL CURRENT ON GROWTH.</h4>

<p>The object of this investigation was to determine
whether anode and cathode exerted similar discriminative
and opposite effects on growth. For this experiment I
took a specimen of <i>Kysoor</i> and determined the region
where growth was maximum. A piece of moist cloth was
wrapped round this region to serve as one of the two
electrodes. The second electrode was placed in the
neighbouring indifferent region where there had been a
cessation of growth.</p>

<p><i>Effect of Cathode: Experiment 111.</i>&mdash;The particular
specimen of <i>Kysoor</i> had a normal rate of growth of
0&middot;48 &micro; per second. On application of the cathode the rate
was reduced to 0&middot;14 &micro; per second, or to less than a third.
This will be seen in record (Fig. 107), where N is the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
normal rate of growth and K, retarded rate under the
action of the cathode.</p>

<p><i>Effect of anode: Experiment 112.</i>&mdash;If the cathode induced
a retardation, the anode might be expected to induce
an acceleration of growth. But in my first experiment
on the action of anode, I could detect no perceptible
variation of rate of growth. In trying to account for this
failure, I found that the specimen employed for the experiment
had normally a very rapid rate of growth. It
appeared that an induced acceleration would be brought
out more conspicuously by choosing a specimen in which
the growth-rate was low, rather than in one in which it
was near its maximum. Acting on this idea, I took
another specimen of <i>Kysoor</i> in which the normal rate was
as slow as 0&middot;10 &micro; per second. On applying the anode<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
to the growing region, there was an enhancement to one
and half times the normal rate (Fig. 108).</p>

<p>The effects given above take place under the action
of a feeble current. Strong current on the other hand
induces a retardation or an arrest of growth.</p>

<p>I have in the above experiments demonstrated the
normal effect of anode in inducing expansion and acceleration
of rate of growth; the cathode was shown to induce
contraction and retardation of growth. Unilateral application
of anode and cathode thus induces appropriate curvatures
in pulvinated and in growing organs.</p>


<h4>SUMMARY.</h4>

<p>The effects of an electric current on growth is modified
by the direction of current. A feeble anodic current
enhances the rate of growth; a cathodic current on the
other hand induces a retardation of the rate. Strong current,
both anodic and cathodic, induces a retardation.</p>

<p>In describing thermonastic curvatures Pfeffer says that
"a special power of thermonastic response has been
developed by various flowers, in which low temperatures
produce closing movements, and high temperatures, opening
ones. The flowers of <i>Crocus vernus</i> and <i>Crocus luteus</i>
are specially responsive, as also those of <i>Tulipa Gesneriana</i>
for these flowers perceptibly respond to a change of
temperature of half a degree centigrade."<a name="FNanchor_A_7" id="FNanchor_A_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>We have hitherto studied the response of various organs
to <i>stimulus</i>; we have now to deal with the effect of
thermal variation. Does rise of temperature act like other
forms of stimuli or is its action different? We have
therefore to find:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(1) The physiological effect of variation of temperature.</p>

<p>(2) Whether thermonastic irritability is confined only
to certain classes of organs, or is it a phenomenon
of very wide occurrence?</p>

<p>(3) Whether variation of temperature induces in anisotropic
organs only one type of response, or two
types, positive and negative.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span></p>
<p>(4) The law which determines the direction of responsive
movement.</p></div>


<h4>EFFECT OF RISE OF TEMPERATURE.</h4>

<p>As regards the effect of rise of temperature we have
seen that, within normal limits, it induces expansion and
acceleration of the rate of growth. Stimulus, on the other
hand, induces precisely the opposite effect. Hence the
physiological reaction of steady rise of temperature is,
generally speaking, antagonistic to that of stimulus. This
conclusion is supported by numerous experiments which I
have carried out with various plant organs. Example of
this will be found in the present and subsequent chapters.</p>


<h4>DIFFERENT THERMONASTIC ORGANS.</h4>

<p>The only condition requisite for the exhibition of
response is the differential excitability of an anisotropic
organ. It is therefore likely to be exhibited by a large
variety of plant organs, such as pulvini, petioles, leaves, and
flowers, and my results show that this is actually the case.
This particular sensibility, moreover, is not confined to
delicate structures, but is extended to rigid trees and their
branches.</p>

<p>Before proceeding further, it is necessary to draw
attention to the confusion which arises from the use
of the common prefix '<i>thermo</i>' in thermonasty and
thermo-tropism. With regard to this Pfeffer says "It
is not known whether radiated and conducted heat
exercise a similar thermotropic reaction."<a name="FNanchor_A_8" id="FNanchor_A_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> I shall show
that the reactions to radiant heat, and to conducted heat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
(rise of temperature) are of opposite character, radiation
inducing contraction, and rise of temperature, expansion.
It is therefore advisable to distinguish the thermal, or
temperature effect, from the radio-thermal effect of infra-red
radiation.</p>


<h4>TWO TYPES OF RESPONSE.</h4>

<p>As regards the effect of variation of temperature I
shall proceed to show that there are two distinct types,
which I shall, for convenience, distinguish as the <i>Positive</i>
and <i>Negative</i>.</p>

<p>Positive thermonastic reaction is exhibited by organs in
which the upper half is the more excitable. Response to
rise of temperature is by <i>downward</i> or <i>outward</i> movement.
In floral organs this finds expression by a movement
of opening. In illustration of this may be cited the
examples of the well known Crocus and also of <i>Zephyranthes</i>.</p>

<p>Negative thermonastic movement is shown by organs in
which the lower half is the more excitable. Here the
response to rise of temperature is by an <i>upward</i> or <i>inward</i>
movement. I shall show that an example of this is
furnished by the flower of <i>Nymph&aelig;a</i> which closes under
rise, and opens during fall of temperature.</p>


<h4>POSITIVE THERMONASTIC RESPONSE.</h4>

<p><i>Response of</i> Zephyranthes: <i>Experiment 113.</i>&mdash;Viewed
from the top, the inner side of the petal of a flower is
the upper side. The <i>Crocus</i> flower under rise of temperature
opens outwards by expansion of the inner side, which
must be the more excitable. As <i>Crocus</i> was not available
in Calcutta, I found the flower of <i>Zephyranthes</i> (sometimes
called the Indian <i>Crocus</i>) reacting to variation of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
temperature in a manner similar to that of <i>Crocus</i>, that is
to say, the flower opens under rise and closes with a fall
of temperature. For obtaining record all the perianth
segments but one was removed. This segment was attached
to the recording lever. On lowering of temperature through
5&deg;C. there was an up-movement, or a movement of closure.
Rise of temperature induced, on the other hand, a movement
of opening.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 109.</span>&mdash;Thermonastic and radionastic responses of petal of <i>Zephyranthes</i>
C, closing movement due to cooling, and H, opening movement due to warming;
R, closing movement due to heat-radiation. Note opposite responses to rise of
temperature and to thermal radiation.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Effect of thermal radiation: Experiment 114.</i>&mdash;I stated
that the effect of thermal radiation acts as a stimulus,
inducing a reaction which is antagonistic to that of rise
of temperature. In verification of this, I subjected the
specimen to the action of infra-red radiation acting from
all sides. The result is seen in the responsive movement
of closure (Fig. 109 R). These experiments demonstrate
clearly that the responses to rise of temperature and
thermal radiation are of opposite signs.</p>

<p>As a movement of closure was induced by the diffuse
stimulus of thermal radiation, it is evident that this must
have been brought about by the greater contraction of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
inner half of the perianth; hence the inner half of the
organ is relatively the more excitable.</p>

<h4>NEGATIVE THERMONASTIC RESPONSE.</h4>

<p><i>Response of</i> Nymph&aelig;a: <i>Experiment 115.</i>&mdash;Many of the
Indian <i>Nymph&aelig;ace&aelig;</i> have their sepals and petals closed
during the day, and open at night. I find that the
perianth leaves of this flower are markedly sensitive to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
variation of temperature. The Thermonastic Recorder employed
in this investigation is shown in figure 110. The
record given in figure 111 shows that the perianth segment,
subjected to a few degrees' rise of temperature,
responded by an up-movement of closure, due to greater
expansion of the outer half. The latent period was 6
seconds, and the maximum effect was attained in the
further course of 21 seconds. This experiment shows that
the thermonastic response of this flower is of the negative
type.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Effect of stimulus: Experiment 116.</i>&mdash;In the positive
type of thermonastic organs, where rise of temperature
induced a movement of opening, stimulus induced the opposite
movement of closure (Expt. 114). We shall now study
the effect of stimulus on the movement of <i>Nymph&aelig;a</i>,
which undergoes closure during rise of temperature, as seen
in the first part of the record in figure 111. Stimulus of
electric shock was applied at the point marked with an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
arrow; the response is seen to be by a movement of
opening. Here also we find the effects of rise of temperature
and of stimulus to be antagonistic to each other.
This will be clearly seen in the following tabular statement.</p>

<p>In <i>Nymph&aelig;a</i> it is the outer side of the perianth that
is relatively the more excitable since diffuse electric
stimulus induces a movement of opening due to the
greater contraction of the outer side. It is by the greater
expansion of this more excitable side that the movement
of closure is effected during rise of temperature.</p>

<p>Thermonastic movements are induced by the differential
physiological effect of variation of temperature on the
two halves of an anisotropic organ.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span></p>

<p>Rise of temperature induces greater expansion, and

of the organ; lowering of temperature induces the opposite
effect.</p>

<p>Two types of thermonastic movements are met with,

of temperature; in these the inner half of the organ is
relatively the more excitable. Example of this is seen in

<p>In the <i>negative</i> type, rise of temperature induces a

<h3><i>By</i><br />

<br /><span class="smcap">Sir J. C. Bose.</span></h3>


<p>In different organs of plants the stimulus of light induces
movements of an extremely varied character. Radial
organs exhibit tropic movements in which the position of
equilibrium is definitely related to the direction of incident
stimulus. Nastic movements under the action of light are,
on the other hand, regarded as curvatures of the organ
which show "no relation to the stimulus but is determined
by the activity of the plant itself".<a name="FNanchor_A_9" id="FNanchor_A_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> There are thus
two classes of response to light which seem to be unrelated
to each other. Returning to the directive action of
light, radial stems often bend towards the light, while
certain roots bend away from it. It may be thought that
this difference is due to specific difference of irritability
between shoot and root, the irritability of the former being
of a positive, and of the latter, of a negative character.
But there are numerous exceptions to this generalisation.
Certain roots bend towards the light, while a stem, under
different circumstances, moves towards light or away from
it. Again an identical organ may exhibit a positive or a
negative curvature. Thus the leaflets of <i>Mimosa pudica</i>
acted on by light from above fold upwards, the phototropic
effect being <i>positive</i>. But the same leaflets acted on
by light from below exhibit a folding upwards, the phototropic
effect being now <i>negative</i>. Effects precisely the
opposite are found with the leaflets of <i>Biophytum</i> and
<i>Averrhoa</i>. They fold downwards whether light acts from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>above or below. Finally, a radial organ in found to exhibit
under light of increasing intensity or duration, a positive,
a dia-phototropic, or a negative phototropic curvature.</p>

<p>In these circumstances the theory of specific positive
and negative irritabilities is untenable; in any case, it
throws no light on the phenomenon of movement. The
difficulties of the problem are thus clearly stated by
Pfeffer: "When we say that an organ curves towards a
source of illumination, because of its heliotropic irritability
and we are simply expressing an ascertained fact in a
conveniently abbreviated form, without explaining why
such curvature is possible or how it is produced....
Many observers have unfortunately devoted their attention
to artificially classifying the phenomenon observed, and
have entirely neglected the explanation of causes underlying
them."<a name="FNanchor_A_10" id="FNanchor_A_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>


<h4>COMPLEXITY OF PROBLEM OF PHOTOTROPIC REACTION.</h4>

<p>The complexity of phototropic reaction arises from the
summated effects of numerous factors; for explanation of
the resultant response it is therefore necessary to take
full account of the individual effect of each of them.</p>

<p>Among these operative factors in phototropic reaction
may be mentioned:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(1) The difference of effects induced by light at the
proximal and distal sides of the organ.</p>

<p>(2) The modification of the latent period with the
intensity of stimulus.</p>

<p>(3) The after-effect of stimulus.</p>

<p>(4) The modifying influence of tonic condition on
response.</p>

<p>(5) The effect of direction of light.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span></p>
<p>(6) The effect of intensity of light.</p>

<p>(7) The effect of duration of stimulation.</p>

<p>(8) The transmitted effect of light.</p>

<p>(9) The effect of unequal excitability in different
zones of the organ.</p>

<p>(10) The effect of transverse conduction in modification
of the sign of response.</p>

<p>(11) The effect of temperature on phototropic action.</p>

<p>(12) The modification of response due to differential
excitability of the organ.</p>

<p>(13) Nastic and tropic reactions.</p>

<p>(14) The torsional effect of light.</p></div>

<p>The sketch given above will give us some idea of the
complexity of the problem. In this and in the following
papers I shall describe the investigations I have carried
out on the subjects detailed above.</p>


<h4>ACTION OF LIGHT.</h4>

<p>I have shown that there is no essential difference
between the responses of pulvinated and growing organs,
that diminution of turgor induced by stimulus brings
about contraction in the one, and retardation of the rate
of growth in the other. Indirect stimulation, on the other
hand, induces an expansion and acceleration of the rate of
growth. The experimental investigation on the tropic effect
of light may therefore be carried out both with pulvinated
and growing organs.</p>

<p>As regards the effect of direct stimulus of light on
growing organs we found (p. 208) that it induces an incipient
contraction, seen in diminution of the rate of growth;
this incipient contraction culminates in an actual contraction
under increasing intensity of light. The contraction<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
under direct stimulation is also observed in pulvinated
organs. When light acts from above the upper half of
the pulvinus undergoes contraction, resulting in erection of
the motile leaf or leaflets. As regards the effect of indirect
unilateral stimulus of light on the distal side of the
organ, we found that its effect is an enhancement of
turgor (p. 281). Hence the positive tropic curvature under
light is brought about, as in the case of other forms of
stimuli, by the contraction of the proximal, and expansion
of the distal sides of the organ.</p>

<p>Various analogies have been noticed between phototropic
and geotropic reactions, and it has been supposed
that the two phenomena are closely related to each other.
This has even led to assumption that there are phototropic
particles which function like statoliths in geotropic
organs. There is, however, certain outstanding difference
between the two classes of phenomena. In the case of
light, the incident energy is entirely derived from the
outside. But in geotropism, the force of gravity by itself
is ineffective without the intervention of the weight of
cell-contents to exert pressure on the sensitive ectoplasm,
and thus induce stimulation. This aspect of the subject
will be treated in greater detail in a subsequent chapter.</p>


<h4>POSITIVE PHOTOTROPIC CURVATURE.</h4>

<p>I shall now describe the phototropic effect of unilateral
light in pulvinated, and in growing organs. From the
explanation that has already been given, it will be understood
that the side of the organ directly acted on by
light undergoes contraction and concavity.</p>

<p><i>Tropic curvature of pulvinated organs: Experiment
117.</i>&mdash;For this experiment I employed the terminal leaflet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
of the bean plant. The source of illumination was 32 c.p.
electric lamp, enclosed in a metallic tube with circular
aperture for passage of light. The leaflet was attached to
an Oscillating Recorder. Light was applied on the upper
half of the pulvinus for 20 seconds; this induced an up-movement
of the leaflet, due to the contraction of the
upper half of the organ. Recovery took place in course
of 8 minutes (Fig. 112).</p>

<h4>POSITIVE PHOTOTROPIC CURVATURE OF GROWING
ORGANS.</h4>

<p><i>Effect of moderate stimulation: Experiment 118.</i>&mdash;I shall
presently show that the intensity of phototropic reaction<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
depends on the intensity and duration of the incident
light. A moderate and effective stimulation may thus be
produced by short exposure to strong light. For my
present experiment I took a stem of <i>Dregea volubilis</i>, and
applied light from a small arc lamp to one side of the
organ for 1 minute; this induced a positive curvature
followed by complete recovery on the cessation of light
(Fig. 113).</p>

curvature is greatly increased (Fig. 114). Thus the phototropic
curvature increases, within limits, with the duration
of stimulation. The curvature induced under stronger<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
stimulation remained more or less persistent. In certain
instances there was a partial recovery after a considerable
length of time; in others curvature was fixed by growth.</p>


<h4>PHENOMENON OF RECOVERY.</h4>

<p>On the cessation of stimulus of moderate intensity the
heliotropically curved organ straightens itself; similar
effects are also found in other tropic curvatures. Thus
a tendril straightens itself after curvature induced by contact
of short duration. The theory of rectipitality has
been proposed to account for the recovery, which assumes
the action of an unknown regulating power by which the
organ is brought back to a straight line; but beyond
the assumption of an unknown specific power, the
theory affords no explanation of the mechanism by
which this is brought about.</p>

<p>The problem before us is to find out the means by
which the organ straightens itself after brief stimulation.
It will also be necessary to find out why there is no
recovery after prolonged stimulation. We have thus to
investigate the after-effect of stimulus of various intensities
on growth, and the Balanced Method of recording Growth
offers us an unique opportunity of studying the characteristic
after-effects.</p>


<h4>IMMEDIATE AND AFTER-EFFECT OF LIGHT ON GROWTH.</h4>

<p>As regards the effect of light I have already shown:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(1) that a sub-minimal stimulus induces an acceleration
of growth, but under long continued
action the acceleration is converted into
normal retardation (p. 225),</p>

<p>(2) that a stimulus of moderate intensity induces the
normal retardation of the rate of growth.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span></p>

<p>It is evident that there is a <i>critical intensity</i> of stimulus,
above which there is a retardation, and below which
there is the opposite reaction of acceleration. This critical
intensity, I have found to be low in vigorous specimens,
and high in sub-tonic specimens. Thus the same
intensity of stimulus may induce a retardation of growth in
specimens the tonic condition of which is <i>above par</i>, and
an acceleration in others, in which it is <i>below par</i>. The
following experiments will demonstrate the immediate and
after-effect of light of increasing intensity and duration.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 640px;">
<img src="images/fig-115.jpg" width="640" height="404" alt="Fig. 115." title="" />
<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 115.</span>&mdash;Immediate and after-effect of stimulus of light on growth. (<i>a</i>) shows
immediate effect of moderate light to be a transitory acceleration (down-curve)
followed by retardation (up-curve). The after-effect on cessation of light is an
acceleration (down-curve) followed by restoration to normal. (<i>b</i>) Immediate and
after-effect of stronger light: immediate effect, a retardation; after-effect, recovery
to normal rate without acceleration.</p>
</div>


<p><i>Effect of light of moderate intensity: Experiment 120.</i>&mdash;The
source of light was a small arc lamp placed at a
distance of 50 cm., the intensity of incident light was
increased or decreased by bringing the source of light nearer
or further away from the plant.  Two inclined mirrors
were placed behind the plant so that the specimen was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
acted on by light from all sides. A seedling of wheat
was mounted on the Balanced Crescograph, and record
was first taken under exact balance; this gives a horizontal
record. The up-curve represents retardation, and
down-curve acceleration of rate of growth. The source
of light was at first placed at a distance of 50 cm.
from the plant, and exposure was given for 4 minutes
at the point marked with an arrow (Fig. 115a). We
shall find in the next chapter that the <i>intensity of
phototropic effect is proportional to the quantity of incident
light</i>. This quantity at the beginning proved to be sub-minimal,
and hence there was an acceleration at the
beginning. Continued action induced the normal effect of
retardation, as seen in the subsequent resulting up-curve. On
the cessation of light, the balance was upset in an opposite
direction, the resulting down-curve showing an acceleration
of the rate of growth above the normal. This acceleration
persisted for a time, after which the normal rate
of growth was restored, as seen in the curve becoming
once more horizontal. <i>The after-effect of light of moderate
intensity is thus a temporary acceleration of rate of
growth above the normal.</i></p>

<p><i>Effect of strong light: Experiment 121.</i>&mdash;The same specimen
was used as in the last experiment. By bringing
the source of light to a distance of 25 cm. the intensity
of light was increased fourfold; the duration of
exposure was kept the same as before. The record (Fig.
115b) shows that a retardation of rate of growth occurred
from the very beginning without the preliminary acceleration.
This is for two reasons: (1) the increased intensity
was now above the critical minimum, and (2) the tone
of the organ had become improved by previous stimulation.
On the cessation of light, the after-effect showed
no enhancement of rate of growth, the recovery from retardation
to the normal rate being gradual. In the next<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
experiment (the result of which is not given in the record)
the intensity of light was increased still further; the
retardation now became very marked, and it persisted for
a long time even on the cessation of light.</p>

<p>We thus find that:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(1) The immediate effect of light of moderate
intensity is a preliminary acceleration, followed
by normal retardation. The acceleration is the
effect of sub-minimal stimulation. The immediate
after-effect is an acceleration above the
normal.</p>

<p>(2) The immediate effect of strong light is a retardation
from the beginning; the immediate after-effect
shows no acceleration, the growth rate being
gradually restored to the normal.</p>

<p>(3) Under very strong light the induced retardation
is very great, and this persists for a long time
even on the removal of light.</p></div>

<p>The experiments described explains the reasons of complete
recovery after moderate stimulation, and also the
absence of recovery after strong stimulation. The immediate
after-effect of moderate stimulation is shown to be
an acceleration of rate above the normal. Returning to
tropic curvature, the contraction at the proximal side
induced by unilateral light is thus compensated by the
accelerated rate of growth on the cessation of light. There
is no such compensation in the case of strong and long
continued action of light; for the after-effect of strong
light shows no such acceleration as the immediate after-effect.</p>

<p>We may perhaps go a step further in explaining this
difference. Stimulus was found to induce at the same
time two physico-chemical reactions of opposite signs (p. 144).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
One is the 'up' or A-change, associated with increase
of potential energy of the system, and the other is associated
with 'down' or D-change, by which there is a
run-down or depletion of energy. With moderate stimulation
the A-and-D effects are more or less comparable to
each other. But under strong stimulation the down-change
is relatively greater. Hence on cessation of moderate
stimulation the increase of potential energy, associated with
A-change, finds expression in enhancement of the rate of
growth. The depletion of energy under strong stimulation
is, however, too great to be compensated by the
A-change.</p>


<h4>LATENT PERIOD OF PHOTOTROPIC REACTION.</h4>

<p>With reference to the latent period Jost thus summarizes
the known results:<a name="FNanchor_A_11" id="FNanchor_A_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> "The latent period of the heliotropic
stimulus has already been determined. According to
Czapek it amounts to 7 minutes in the cotyledons of
<i>Avena</i> and in <i>Phycomyces</i>; 10 minutes in hypocotyls of
<i>Sinapis alba</i> and <i>Beta vulgaris</i>, 20 minutes in the hypocotyl
of <i>Helianthus</i>, and 50 minutes in the epicotyl of
<i>Phaseolus</i>. If one of these organs be unilaterally illuminated
for the specified time, heliotropic curvature ensues
afterwards in the dark, that is to say, we meet with an
after-effect in this case as in geotropism. We are quite
ignorant, however, as to whether and how the latent
period is dependent on the intensity of light."</p>

<p>With regard to the question of relation of the latent
period to the intensity of stimulus I have shown (p. 166)
that the latent period is shortened under increasing intensity
of stimulus. In the case of tropic curvature induced by
light, I find that the latent period is reduced under<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
increasing intensity of light. The shortest latent period
found by Czapek, as stated before, was 7 minutes. But by
employing high magnification for record, I find that the
latent period of phototropic action under strong light to be
a question of seconds.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 640px;">

</div>

<p><i>Determination of the latent period: Experiment 122.</i>&mdash;I
give a record of response (Fig. 116) of the terminal leaflet
of <i>Erythrina inidca</i> to light acting from above. The
recording plate was made to move at a fast rate, the
successive dots being at intervals of 2 seconds. The latent
period in this case is seen to be 35 seconds. By the
employment of stronger light I have obtained latent period
which is very much shorter.</p>

<p>The term latent period is used in two different sense.
It may mean the interval between the application of
stimulus and the initiation of response. In the experiment
described above, the latent period is to be understood
in this sense. But in the extract given above, Jost uses
the term latent period as the shortest period of exposure
necessary to induce phototropic reaction as an after-effect.
What then is the shortest exposure that will induce a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
retardation of growth? For this investigation I employed
the very sensitive method of the Balanced Crescograph.</p>

<h4>GROWTH-VARIATION BY FLASH OF LIGHT FROM  A
SINGLE SPARK.</h4>

<p><i>Experiment 123.</i>&mdash;I stated that the more intense is the
light, the shorter is the latent period. The duration of a
single spark discharge from a Leyden jar is almost
instantaneous, the duration of discharge being of the order of
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>100,000</sub>th of a second. The single discharge was made to
take place between two small steel spheres, the light
given out by the spark being rich in effective ultra-violet
rays. The plant used for the experiment was a seedling
of wheat. It was mounted on the Balanced Crescograph,
and its normal growth was exactly compensated as seen
in the first part of the record.  The spark gap was
placed at a distance of 10 cm. from the plant; there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
was the usual arrangement of inclined mirrors for illumination
of the plant. The flash of light from a single
spark is seen to induce a sudden retardation of rate of
growth which lasted for one and half minutes. The
record (Fig. 117) shows another interesting peculiarity of
acceleration as an after-effect of moderate stimulation.
After the retardation which lasted for 90 seconds, there
is an acceleration of growth above the normal, which
persisted for 6 minutes, after which the rate of growth
returned to the normal.</p>

<p>In order to show that the induced variation is due to
the action of light and not to any other disturbance,
I interposed a sheet of ebonite between the spark-gap and
the plant. The production of spark produced no effect,
but the removal of the ebonite screen was at once
followed by the characteristic response.</p>


<h4>MAXIMUM POSITIVE CURVATURE UNDER CONTINUED
ACTION OF LIGHT.</h4>

<p>The positive curvature is, as we have seen, due to the
contraction of the proximal side and expansion of the
distal side. The curvature will increase with growing
contraction of the proximal side; a maximum curvature
is however reached since:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(1) the contraction of the cells must have a limit,</p>

<p>(2) the bending organ offers increasing resistance to
curvature, and</p>

<p>(3) the induced curvature tends to place the organ
parallel to the direction of light when the
tropic effect is reduced to a minimum.</p></div>

<p>The pulvinus of <i>Erythrina</i> exemplifies the type of
reaction in which the positive curvature reaches a maximum,
(see below Fig. 132) beyond which there is no further<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
change. This is due to absence of transverse conductivity
in the organ. The modifying effect of transverse conductivity
on response will be dealt with in the next chapter.</p>


<h4>SUMMARY.</h4>

<p>The positive phototropic curvature is brought about by
the joint effects of the directly stimulated proximal, and
indirectly stimulated distal side.</p>

<p>The phototropically curved organ undergoes recovery
after brief stimulation.</p>

<p>The recovery after moderate stimulation is hastened by
the previously stimulated side exhibiting an acceleration of
the rate of growth above the normal. The after-effects
of photic and mechanical stimulation are similar.</p>

<p>The latent period of photic reaction is shortened with
the increasing intensity of light. The seedling of wheat
responds to a flash of light from an electric spark, the
duration of which is about a hundred thousandth part of
a second.</p>

<p>Tissues in which the power of transverse conduction
is negligible, the positive phototropic curvature under
continued action of light attains a maximum without
subsequent neutralisation or reversal.</p>

<br /><span class="smcap">Guruprasanna Das.</span></h3>


<p>I have explained how under the action of unilateral
light the positive curvature attains a maximum. There
are, however, cases where under the continued action of
strong light the tropic movement undergoes a reversal.
Thus to quote Jost: "Each organism may be found in
one of the three different conditions determined by the
light intensity, <i>viz.</i> (1) a condition of positive heliotropism,
(2) a condition of indifference, (3) a condition of negative
heliotropism"<a name="FNanchor_A_12" id="FNanchor_A_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>. No explanation has however been
offered as to why the same organ should exhibit at
different times, a positive, a neutral, and a negative irritability.
These changing effects exhibited by an identical
organ is thus incompatible with the theory of specific
sensibility, assumed in explanation of characteristic differences
in phototropic response.</p>

<p>In regard to this I would draw attention to an
important factor which modifies the tropic response, namely,
the effect of transverse conduction of excitation. I shall
presently describe in detail a typical experiment of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
effect of unilateral stimulus of light on the responsive
movement of main pulvinus of <i>Mimosa pudica</i>. The
results will be found of much theoretical interest, since a
single experiment will give an insight to all possible types
of phototropic response. Before describing the experiment
I shall demonstrate the tropic reactions of the two halves
of the pulvinus of <i>Mimosa</i>.</p>


<h4>UNEQUAL EXCITABILITY OF UPPER AND LOWER HALVES OF
PULVINUS TO PHOTIC STIMULATION.</h4>

<p>I have by method of selective amputation shown that
as regards electric stimulation the excitability of the upper
half of the pulvinus is very much less than that of the
lower half (p. 85). I have obtained similar results with
photic stimulation.</p>

<p><i>Tropic effect of light acting from above: Experiment
124.</i>&mdash;Light of moderate intensity from an incandescent
electric lamp was applied on the upper half of the pulvinus
of <i>Mimosa</i> for 4 minutes; this induced a contraction
of the stimulated upper half and gave rise to an up or
erectile response. On the stoppage of light recovery took
place in the course of ten minutes. The phototropic
curvature is thus seen to be positive. A series of such
positive responses of the upper half of the pulvinus is
given in figure 118.</p>

<p><i>Effect of light acting from below: Experiment 125.</i>&mdash;Light
was now applied from below; this also induced a
contraction of the lower half of the pulvinus, causing a
down-movement (Fig. 119). As the responsive movement is
towards light, the phototropic effect must be regarded as
positive. The greater excitability of the lower half of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
pulvinus is shown by the fact that the response of the
lower half of the pulvinus to ten seconds' exposure is
even larger than that given by the upper half under the
prolonged exposure of 240 seconds.</p>

<h4>TRANSFORMATION OF POSITIVE TO NEGATIVE PHOTOTROPIC
CURVATURE.</h4>

<p><i>Experiment 126.</i>&mdash;A beam of light from a small arc
lamp was thrown on the upper half of the pulvinus.
After a latent period of 5 seconds, a positive curvature
was initiated, by the contraction of the upper and expansion
of the lower side of the organ. But under continued
action of light, the excitatory impulse reached the lower
half of the organ, causing a rapid fall of the leaf,
and a <i>negative</i> curvature. The arrival of transmitted excitation
at the more excitable distal half of the organ is
clearly demonstrated by the very rapid down-movement,
seen as the up-curve in the record (Fig. 120). In sensitive
specimens this movement is so abrupt and rapid, that the
writing lever is jerked off above the recording plate
before making a dot on it. The thickness of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
pulvinus was 1&middot;5 mm., the distance which the excitatory
impulse has to traverse to reach the lower half would thus
be about 0&middot;75 mm. The period for transverse transmission
of excitation under strong light was found to vary in
different cases from 50 to 80 seconds. The velocity of
transmission of excitation in a transverse direction through
the pulvinus is about 0&middot;011 mm. per second, which is
not very different from 0&middot;010 mm. per second in the stem
(p. 282).</p>



<div class="figcenter" style="width: 640px;">

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 120.</span>&mdash;Record of effect of continuous application of light on upper half

followed by neutralisation and pronounced reversal into negative due to transverse
conduction of excitation. Up-movement shown by down curve, and <i>vice
vers&acirc;</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>Returning to the main experiment we find that:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(1) As a result of unilateral action of light, there was
positive phototropic curvature which lasted for
50 seconds.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span></p>
<p>(2) Owing to the internal conduction of excitation the
positive effect underwent neutralisation by the
excitatory contraction of the distal side. This
neutralisation depends on four factors: (<i>a</i>) on the
intensity of the stimulus, (<i>b</i>) on the conductivity
of the organ in a transverse direction, (<i>c</i>) on the
thickness of the intervening tissue, and (<i>d</i>) on the
relative excitability of the distal as compared to
the proximal side. The extent of positive curvature
also depends on the pliability of the organ.</p>

<p>(3) In anisotropic organs where the distal side is
physiologically the more excitable than the proximal,
the internally diffused excitation brings
about a greater contraction of the distal, and the
<i>positive</i> phototropic curvature becomes reversed
to a very pronounced <i>negative</i>. The effect of
the internally diffused stimulus is thus the same
as that of external diffuse stimulus.</p>

<p>(4) When the stimulus is applied on the more excitable
half of the organ, the result is a predominant
contraction of that half, which cannot be
neutralised by the excitation conducted to the
less excitable half of the organ. As the curvature
is towards the stimulus, the phototropic
curvature thus remains positive, even under
continued stimulation.</p></div>

<p>The positive curvature is due to the differential action
of unilateral stimulus on the proximal and distal sides. But
when a strong light is made to act continuously on one side
of an organ, the excitation becomes internally diffused, and
the differential effect on the two sides is reduced in amount
or vanishes altogether. Owing to the weak transverse
conductivity of the tissue, while the effect of a feeble
stimulus remains localised, that of a stronger stimulus is
conducted across it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span></p>

<p>Oltmanns found that the seedling of <i>Lepidium sativum</i>
assumed a transverse or dia-phototropic position under
intense and long continued action of light of 600,000 Hefner
lamps. He regards this as the indifferent position.
But the neutralisation of curvature is not, as explained
before, due to a condition of indifference, but to the antagonistic
effects of the two opposite sides of the organ, the
proximal being stimulated by the direct, and the distal
by the transversely conducted excitation. I obtained such
neutralisation with <i>Dregea volubilis</i> under the prolonged
unilateral action of arc-light. The first effect was positive;
this was gradually and continuously neutralised under exposure
for two hours; even then the neutralisation was
not complete. I shall presently adduce instances where the
neutralisation was not merely complete, but the final effect
was an actual reversal into negative response.</p>


<h4>SUPPOSED PHOTOTROPIC INEFFECTIVENESS OF SUNLIGHT.</h4>

<p>I may here consider the remarkable fact that has been
observed, but for which no explanation has been forthcoming,
that "direct sunlight is too bright to bring about
heliotropic curvature, only diffuse, not direct sunlight has
the power of inducing heliotropic movements."<a name="FNanchor_A_13" id="FNanchor_A_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> But we
cannot conceive of light suddenly losing its phototropic
effect by an increase of intensity. The experiment just
described will offer full explanation for this apparent
anomaly. Feeble or moderate stimulus remains, as we
have seen, localised, hence the contraction of the proximal
side gives rise to positive curvature. But the intense
excitation caused by sunlight would be transmitted
to the distal side and thus bring about neutralisation.
It is the observation of the final result that has misled
observers as to the inefficiency of direct sunlight. A
continuous record of the response of the organ shows, on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
the other hand, that the first effect of strong light is a
positive curvature, and that under its continuous action the
positive effect becomes neutralised (cf. Fig. 121). In the
study of phototropic action, the employment of strong
light has many advantages, since the period of experiment
is, by this means, materially shortened. The continuous
record then gives an epitome of the various phases of
reaction.</p>


<h4>NEGATIVE PHOTOTROPISM.</h4>

<p>I shall next show the continuity of responsive phototropic
effects, from the positive curvature to the negative,
through the intermediate phase of neutralisation. I have
in the preceding paragraph described an experiment where
under a given intensity and duration of exposure the
excitations of the proximal and distal sides bring about
neutralisation, the organ assuming a dia-phototropic position.
If the intensity or duration of the stimulating light
be further increased, it is easy to see that while excitation
transmitted to the distal side is being increased, the excitatory
contraction on the proximal side may, at the same
time, be decreased owing to fatigue brought on by over-stimulation.</p>

</div>

<p>In connection with this it should be borne in mind
that the pulvinus of <i>Mimosa</i> exhibits under continuous
stimulation, a fatigue relaxation instead of normal contraction.
Similar effects are known to take place in animal
muscles. The effect of relatively greater excitation will thus
give rise to negative phototropic curvature. The transverse
conductivity of organs of diverse plants will necessarily
be different. The neutralisation and reversal into negative
will thus depend on three factors: the transverse conductivity
of the organ, the intensity, and duration of stimulus.</p>

<p><i>Neutralisation and reversal under increased intensity
of light: Experiment 127.</i>&mdash;It is advisable to employ thin
specimens (in which the transverse distance is small) for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
the exhibition of reversal effect. I took a hypocotyl of
<i>Sinapis nigra</i> and subjected it to unilateral action of light
from a 16 candle-power incandescent electric lamp placed
at a distance of 10 cm. A maximum positive curvature
was induced in the course of 50 minutes. The intensity of
light was afterwards increased by bringing the lamp nearer
to a distance of 6 cm. This resulted in a process of
neutralisation of the preceding response; after an exposure
of 70 minutes the specimen assumed a dia-phototropic
position in which it remained in equilibrium. Sunlight was
next applied, and in the further course of 30 minutes there
was a pronounced reversal into negative phototropic curvature.</p>


<p><i>Neutralisation and reversal under continuous stimulation:
Experiment 128.</i>&mdash;In the
last experiment the different
changes in the response were
brought about by successive
increase in the intensity of
light. In the present experiment,
very strong light was
applied from the beginning,
and continuous record was
taken of the change in the
response. In order to reduce
the period of experiment I
employed a mercury vapour
lamp which emits the most
effective violet and ultra-violet
rays. The specimen used
was a seedling of the rice
plant (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). The
first effect of light was a positive
curvature which attained
its maximum; after this there was a neutralisation in less
than six minutes after the application of light. The further<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
continuation of light induced a pronounced negative curvature
(Fig. 121).</p>

<p>I shall in the next chapter give other instances which
will show that all organs (pulvinated and growing) possessed
of power of transverse conduction, exhibit a transformation
of response from positive to negative under continued action
of strong light.</p>

<p>Thus an identical organ, under different conditions of
intensity and duration of stimulus, exhibits <i>positive</i> phototropic,
<i>dia</i>-phototropic, and <i>negative</i> phototropic curvatures,
proving conclusively that the three effects are not due
to three distinct irritabilities. The responsive movements
are, on the other hand, traced to a fundamental excitatory
reaction, remaining either localised or increasingly
transmitted to the distal side.</p>


<h4>NEGATIVE PHOTOTROPISM OF ROOTS.</h4>

<p>From the analogy of opposite responses of shoot and
root to stimulus of gravity, it was surmised that the
root would respond to light by a negative curvature. This
was apparently confirmed by the negative phototropic
curvature of the root of <i>Sinapis</i>. The supposed analogy is
however false; for while the stimulus of gravity acts, in
the case of root, only on a restricted area of the tip,
the stimulus of light is not necessarily restricted in the
area of its action. That there is no true analogy between
the action of light and gravitation is seen from
the fact that while gravitation induces in the root a
movement opposite to that in the stem, in the case of
light, this is not always so; for though a few roots turn
away from light, others move towards the light.</p>

<p>As regards negative phototropic response of the root of
<i>Sinapis</i>, it will be shown (p. 376) to be brought about by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
algebraical summation of the effects of direct and indirect
photic stimulus.</p>


<h4>SUMMARY.</h4>

<p>The normal positive phototropic curvature is modified by
transverse conduction of true excitation to the distal side
of the organ.</p>

<p>The extent of neutralisation or reversal due to internal
conduction of excitation from the proximal to the distal
side of the organ depends: (<i>a</i>) on the intensity of the incident
stimulus, (<i>b</i>) on the conductivity of the organ in a
transverse direction, (<i>c</i>) on the thickness of the intervening
tissue, and (<i>d</i>) on the relative excitability of the distal as
compared to the proximal side.</p>

<p>The dia-phototropic position is not one of indifference,
but of balanced antagonistic reactions of two opposite
sides of the organ.</p>

<p>The supposition that direct sunlight is phototropically
ineffective is unfounded. The response is fully vigorous, but
the first positive curvature may in certain cases be neutralised
by the transmission of excitation to the distal side.</p>

<p>Under light of strong intensity and long duration, the
transmitted excitation to the distal side neutralises, and
finally reverses the positive into negative curvature.</p>

<p>The <i>positive</i>-phototropic, the <i>dia</i>-phototropic, and the
<i>negative</i> phototropic curvatures are not due to three distinct
irritabilities but are brought about by a fundamental
excitatory reaction remaining localised or increasingly
transmitted to the distal side.</p>

<p>I shall in this chapter describe experiments in support
of the important proposition that <i>the intensity of phototropic
action is dependent on the quantity of incident light</i>. The
proportionality of the tropic effect to the quantity of light
will be found to hold good for the median range of stimulation;
the deviation from this proportionality at the two
ends of the range of stimulation&mdash;the sub-minimal and supramaximal&mdash;is,
as we shall find, capable of explanation, and
will be fully dealt with in the next chapter.</p>

<p>The quantity of light incident on the responding organ
depends: (1) on the intensity of light, (2) on the angle of
inclination or <i>the directive angle</i>,<a name="FNanchor_A_14" id="FNanchor_A_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> and (3) on the duration

relating to the individual effects of each of these
factors on the tropic reactions not merely in pulvinated but
also in growing organs.</p>


<h4>EFFECT OF INCREASING INTENSITY OF LIGHT ON TROPIC
CURVATURE.</h4>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 480px;">

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 122.</span>&mdash;Leaf of <i>Desmodium gyrans</i>,
with the terminal large, and two lateral
small leaflets.  These latter exhibit
automatic pulsations.</p>
</div>

<p>The intensity of light was increased in successive experiments,
in arithmetical progression 1:2:3 by suitably diminishing
the distance between the plant and the source of
light, and the resulting tropic curvatures recorded.</p>

<p><i>Effect of increasing intensity of light on the pulvinus of</i>
Desmodium gyrans: <i>Experiment 129.</i>&mdash;The source of light
was a 50 candle-power incandescent lamp, and the duration
of exposure was 1 minute. The specimen employed was
a terminal leaflet of <i>Desmodium gyrans</i> (Fig. 122) the
pulvinus of which is very
sensitive to light. It is more
convenient to manipulate a
cut specimen of the leaf,
instead of the whole plant.
The petiole is placed in
water contained in a U-tube;
the depressing effect of wound
passes off in the course of
an hour or so. Light of
increasing intensity is applied
from above; this induces
a contraction of the upper half of the pulvinus, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
the resulting response is recorded by means of the
Oscillating Recorder (Fig. 123).</p>


<p>The first record was obtained under a given intensity,
and the second, under an intensity twice as great. The
tropic effects are seen to increase with the intensity
(Fig. 124). If the tropic curvature increased proportionately
to the intensity, the two responses should have been
in the ratio of 1:2; the actual ratio was however
slightly greater, <i>viz.</i> 1:2&middot;6. In this connection it will be
shown in the next chapter, that strict proportionality holds
good only in the median range, and that the susceptibility
for excitation undergoes an increase at the beginning of
the phototropic curve.</p>

organ (<i>Crinum</i>).</p>
</div>



<p><i>Effect of increasing intensity of light on the tropic
curvature of growing organs.</i>&mdash;As the tropic curvature is
primarily due to the retardation of growth induced by light
at the proximal side of the organ, it will be of interest to
recapitulate the results I obtained (p. 208) on the effects
of increasing intensity of light on growth itself. The
normal rate of growth of the specimen in the dark was
0&middot;47 &micro; per second; this was reduced to 0&middot;29 &micro; under an
intensity of one unit, to 0&middot;17 &micro; under two, and to 0&middot;10 &micro;
under three units. Growth became arrested when the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
intensity was raised to four units. Thus increasing
intensity of light induces an increasing retardation of
growth at the proximal side of the organ. This aided by
the effect of indirect stimulus at the distal side brings
about an increasing positive curvature.</p>

<p><i>Experiment 130.</i>&mdash;The flower bud of <i>Crinum</i> was used
for the experiment, the source of light being a small arc
lamp. The duration of exposure was one minute. Increasing
intensity of light gave rise to increasing positive
curvatures (Fig. 125) in the ratio of 1:2&middot;5:5 under
increasing intensities which varied as 1:2:3.</p>


<h4>THE EFFECT OF INCREASING ANGLE.</h4>

<p>The quantity of light which falls on an unit area of
the responding organ varies as sin &#952; where &#952; is the directive
angle <i>i.e.</i> the angle made by the rays with the
surface. Some allowance has to be made for the amount
of light reflected from the surface, this being greater at 45&deg;
than at 90&deg;.</p>

<p><i>Tropic response of pulvinus of</i> Desmodium gyrans:

an incandescent electric lamp was mounted at one end

other (Fig. 126). The parallel beam of light from the
collimator could be sent at various angles by rotating the
collimator tube round an axis at right angles to the tube.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
The specimen employed was the terminal leaflet of <i>Desmodium
gyrans</i>; light was applied for a minute in the
two successive experiments for the two angles of 45&deg; and
90&deg;. The record (Fig. 127) shows that the phototropic
effect increases with the directive angle. In the present
case the ratio of the two effects is 1&middot;6:1, which is not very
different from the ratio <sup>sin 90&deg;</sup>&frasl;<sub>sin 45&deg;</sub> = 1&middot;4.</p>

<p><i>Tropic response of growing organs: Experiment 132.</i>&mdash;Similar
experiment was carried out with the flower bud
of <i>Crinum</i>, held vertical. Light was applied alternately
at 45&deg; and 90&deg;, in two successive series. The object of
this was to make due allowance of possible variation of
excitability of the organ during the course of the experiment.
I have explained (p. 147), how the excitability of
a tissue in a condition slightly below par, is increased by
the action of previous stimulation. Series of responses
obtained under alternate stimulations at 45&deg; and 90&deg;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
enable us to find out, whether any variation of excitability
occurred during the course of the experiment and
make allowance for it. The records show that stimulation
did enhance the excitability of the organ to a small
extent. Thus the first stimulation at 45&deg; induced an
amplitude of response of 5 mm.; the second stimulation
at 45&deg; <i>i.e.</i> the third response of the series, induced a
slightly larger response 7 mm. in amplitude. Similarly
the two responses at 90&deg; gave an amplitude of 9 mm.
and 11 mm. respectively (Fig. 128). Taking the mean
value of each pair, the ratio of tropic effects for 90&deg;
and 45&deg; is = <sup>10</sup>&frasl;<sub>6</sub> = 1&middot;7 nearly.</p>


<h4>EFFECT OF DURATION OF EXPOSURE.</h4>

<p><i>Experiment 133.</i>&mdash;The specimen employed for the experiment
was a flower bud of <i>Crinum</i> in a slightly sub-tonic
condition. Successive responses exhibited on this account, a
preliminary negative<a name="FNanchor_A_15" id="FNanchor_A_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> before the normal positive curvature.
The successive durations of exposure were for 1, 2, and
3 minutes. The amplitudes of responses (Fig. 129) are in
the ratio of 1:2&middot;5:5.</p>

<p>We may now recapitulate the tropic effects of light of
increasing intensity, directive angle, and duration of exposure.
It has been shown that the tropic effect is enhanced
under increasing intensity of light; it is also increased
with the angle increasing from grazing to perpendicular
incidence. And finally, the tropic effect is enhanced
with the duration of exposure. Taking into consideration
the effects of these different factors we arrive at the conclusion
that <i>phototropic effect increases with the quantity
of incident light</i>. It will be shown in the next chapter
that strict proportionality of cause and effect holds good
in the median range of stimulation, and the slight deviation
from this, above and below the median range, is
due to the fact that susceptibility for excitation is low
at these two regions.</p>


<h4>SUMMARY.</h4>

<p>Increasing intensity of light induces increasing tropic
curvature.</p>

<p>Tropic curvature increases with the directive angle, the
effect being approximately proportional to sin &#952;, where &#952;
is the angle made by the rays with the responding surface.</p>

<p>Tropic curvature also increases with the duration of
exposure.</p>

<p>The intensity of induced tropic effect is determined by

CHARACTERISTICS</h2>

<h3><i>By</i><br />

<br /><span class="smcap">Sir J. C. Bose</span>.</h3>


<p>When a plant organ is subjected to the continued
action of unilateral stimulus of light, it exhibits increasing
tropic curvature, which in certain cases reaches
a limit; in other instances a reversal takes place, seen in
neutralisation, or in the conversion of the positive into
negative curvature. I shall in this chapter enter into a
detailed study of the phototropic curve, and determine its
characteristics.</p>

<p>As the vague terminology at present in use has been
the source of much confusion, it is necessary here to
define clearly the various terms which will be employed
in this investigation. It is first of all necessary to distinguish
between cause and effect, between external stimulus
and the excitation induced by it. As regards stimulus
itself I have shown elsewhere<a name="FNanchor_A_16" id="FNanchor_A_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> that its effective intensity
becomes summated by repetition. This was demonstrated
by the two following typical experiments carried out with
the pulvinus of <i>Mimosa</i>.</p>


<p>(1) The intensity of a single electric shock of intensity
of 0&middot;5 unit was found to be ineffective in  inducing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
excitation; but it  became effective on being repeated
four times in rapid succession.</p>

<p>(2) The same specimen was next subjected to a feebler
stimulus of intensity of 0&middot;1 unit, and it required a repetition
of 20 times for the stimulus to become effective.</p>

<p>The total stimulus in the first case was 0&middot;5 &times; 4 = 2, and
this was found to be the same as 0&middot;1 &times; 20 = 2 in the
second case. Thus the intensity of stimulus is increased
by repetition; in the limiting case where the interval
between successive stimulus is zero, the stimulus becomes
continuous. Bearing in mind the additive effects of stimulus
we see that its effective intensity increases with the
<i>duration</i> of application. This important conclusion found
independent support from the results of Experiment 133
given in the last chapter.</p>

<p>We shall now take up the general question of the
characteristics of the phototropic curve, which gives the
relation between increasing stimulus and the resulting excitation.
As regards stimulus we found that its effectiveness
increases with the duration of application. The
induced excitation in growing organs may be measured by
concomitant retardation of growth caused by stimulus. In
the excitation curves which will be presently given, the
abscissae represent increasing stimulus and ordinates the
resulting excitation. This excitation curve may be obtained
by making the plant record on a moving plate its
retardation of growth by means of the High Magnification
Crescograph. I reproduce below two records of the effects
of continuous photic and electric stimulation. The ordinate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
of the 'excitation curve' (Fig. 130) exhibits increasing incipient
contraction (retardation of growth) culminating in an
arrest of growth; the abscissa represents increasing stimulus
consequent on increased duration of application. The
record shows that the incipient contraction is slight at
the first stage; it increases rapidly in the second stage;
finally, it declines and reaches a limit. The excitatory
reaction is thus not constant throughout the entire
curve of excitation, but undergoes very definite and
characteristic changes. We shall find similar characteristics
in the phototropic curves under unilateral stimulus which
will be given presently. The explanation of the similarity
is found in the fact that the tropic curvature is also due
to incipient contraction or retardation of the rate of
growth, which remains confined to the directly stimulated
proximal side of the organ.</p>

growth. Abscissa represents duration of application of stimulus. Note induced
retardation, and arrest of growth.</p>
</div>


<p>For facility of explanation of what follows, I shall
have to use a new and necessary term, <i>susceptibility</i>, to
indicate the relation of cause and effect, of stimulus and
resulting excitation. <i>Susceptibility</i> is thus = <sup>Excitation</sup>&frasl;<sub>Stimulus.</sub>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
Different organs of plants exhibit unequal susceptibilities;
some undergo excitation under feeble stimulus,
while others require more intense stimulus to induce
excitation. But even in an identical organ the
susceptibility undergoes, as we have seen, a characteristic
variation, being feeble at the beginning of the excitation
curve, considerable in the middle, and becoming feeble
once more towards the end of the curve. The most
difficult problem that faces us is an explanation of this
characteristic difference in different parts of the tropic
curve.</p>


<h4>GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS.</h4>

<p>Before entering into the fuller consideration of the
subject, it will be helpful to form some mental picture of
the phenomena of excitation, however inadequate it may
be. The excitation is admitted to be due to the molecular
upset induced by the shock of stimulus<a name="FNanchor_A_17" id="FNanchor_A_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>; the increased
excitation results from increasing molecular upset brought
on by enhanced stimulus. The condition of molecular
upset or excitation may be detected from the record of
any one of the several concomitant changes, such as the
change of form, (contraction or expansion) or change of
electric condition (galvanometric negativity or positivity).
These means of investigation are not in principle different
from those we employ in the detection of molecular distortion
in inorganic matter under increasing intensities of
an external force.</p>


<h4>THE CHARACTERISTIC CURVE.</h4>

<p>Thus the molecular upset and rearrangement, in a
magnetic substance under increasing magnetising force are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
inferred from the curve obtained by means of appropriate
magnetometric or galvanometric methods. I reproduce the
characteristic curve of iron (Fig. 131) in which the abscissa
represents increasing magnetising force, and the ordinate,
the induced magnetisation. This characteristic curve, giving
the relation of cause and effect, will be found to be
highly suggestive as regards the similar characteristic
curve which gives the relation between increasing stimulus
and the resulting enhanced tropic effect in vegetable
tissues. The parallelism will be found to be very striking.</p>

<p>Inspection of figure 131 shows that, broadly speaking,
the curve of magnetisation may be divided into four parts.
In the first part, under feeble magnetic force, the slope of
the curve is very small; later, in the second part, as the
force increases, the curve becomes very steep; in the third
part the slope of the curve remains fairly constant;
and finally in the fourth part, the curve rounds off and
the rate of ascent again becomes very small. The <i>susceptibility</i>
for induced magnetisation is thus very feeble at
the beginning; under increasing force, in the second stage,
the susceptibility becomes greatly enhanced; in the third
stage, the susceptibility remains approximately constant;
and in the fourth stage it becomes diminished. We shall
presently find that the susceptibility for excitation also
undergoes a similar variation at the four different stages
of stimulation.</p>


<h4>CHARACTERISTICS OF SIMPLE PHOTOTROPIC CURVE.</h4>

<p>I have shown (Fig. 130) the relation between the
stimulus and the resulting excitation, the latter being determined
from the diminution of the rate of growth. Under
unilateral action of light, the excitatory contraction gives
rise to tropic curvature. We may thus obtain the characteristic
excitation curve, by making the plant organ record<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
its tropic  movement under continuous action of  light
applied on one side of the organ.</p>

<p>The induced excitation is seen to be increased very
gradually from the zero point of susceptibility, known as
the latent period at which no excitation takes place. In
the second part of the excitation curve, the rate of increase
is vary rapid; the maximum rate is nearly reached at
point 11 of the curve and remains fairly constant for a
time. This is the median range where equal increment of
stimulus induces equal increment of excitation. The susceptibility
for excitation then falls rapidly, and increase of
stimulus induces no further increase of tropic curvature.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
The maximum tropic curvature was, in the present case,
reached in the course of nine minutes. The attainment of
this maximum depends on the excitability of the tissue, and
the intensity of incident stimulus. The characteristics that
have been described are not confined to the phototropic
curve but exhibited by tropic curves in general. Similar
characteristics have been found in the curve for electric
stimulus (Fig. 130a), and will also be met with in the curve
for geotropic stimulus (Fig. 161).</p>

<p>I may here refer incidentally to the three types of
responses exhibited by an organ to successive stimuli of
uniform intensity; these appear to correspond to the three
different regions of tropic curve; in the first stage, the
plant exhibits a tendency to exhibit a 'staircase' increase of
response; in the intermediate stage, the response is uniform;
and in the last stage, the responses show a 'fatigue' decline.</p>

<p>For purpose of simplicity, I first selected the simple
type of phototropic curve, where the specimen employed
was in a favourable tonic condition, and the stimulus was,
from the beginning, above the minimal. Transverse conduction,
which induces neutralisation or reversal into
negative, was moreover absent in the specimen. I shall now
take up the more complex cases: (1) where the condition of
the specimen is slightly sub-tonic, (2) where the stimulus
is gradually increased from the <i>sub-minimal</i>, and (3) where
the specimen possesses the power of transverse conduction.</p>


<h4>EFFECT OF SUB-MINIMAL STIMULUS.</h4>

<p>It is unfortunate that the terms in general use for description
of effective stimulus should be so very indefinite.
A stimulus which is just sufficient to evoke excitatory <i>contraction</i>
is termed the minimal, stimulus below the threshold
being tacitly regarded as ineffective. The employment
of sensitive recorders has, however, enabled me to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
discover the important fact that stimulus below the minimal,
though ineffective in inducing excitatory <i>contraction</i>, is not
below the threshold of perception. The plant not merely
perceives such stimulus, but also responds to it in a definite
way, by <i>expansion</i> instead of <i>contraction</i>. I shall designate
the stimulus below the minimal, as the <i>sub-minimal</i>. There
is a critical point, which demarcates the sub-minimal stimulus
with its expansive reaction from the minimal with its responsive
contraction.</p>

<p>The <i>critical</i> stimulus varies in different species of
plants. Thus the same intensity of light which induces a
retardation of growth in one species of plants will enhance
the rate of growth in another. Again, the critical point
will vary with the <i>tonic</i> level of the same organ; in an
optimum condition of the tissue, a relatively feeble stimulus
will be sufficient to evoke excitatory contraction; the critical
point is therefore low for tissues in tonic condition which
may be described as <i>above par</i>. In a sub-tonic condition,
on the other hand, strong and long continued stimulation
will be necessary to induce the excitatory reaction. The
critical point is therefore high, for tissues in a condition
<i>below par</i>. Stimulus below the critical point will here
induce the opposite physiological reaction, <i>i.e.</i>, expansion.
The physico-chemical reactions underlying these opposite
physiological responses have, for convenience, been distinguished
as the "A" and "D" change (pp. 143, 223). The
assimilatory 'building up', A change, is associated with an
increase of potential energy of the system; the dissimilatory
'break down', D change, on the other hand, is attended
by a run-down of energy.</p>

<p>Stimulus was shown (p. 225) to give rise to <i>both</i> these
reactions, though the A effect is, generally speaking, masked
by the predominant D effect. The "A" change is quicker
in initiation, while the "D" effect developes later; again<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
the "A" effect under moderate stimulation may persist
longer. Thus owing to the difference in their time-relations
the A effect is capable of being unmasked at the onset
of stimulus or on its sudden cessation. For the detection
of the relatively feeble expansive A effect, a special
recorder is required which combines lightness with high
power of magnification. The earlier expansive reaction and
acceleration of rate of growth, followed by normal retardation,
are often found in the response of growing organs.
The corresponding effect of unilateral stimulation, even
when direct, is a transient expansion at the proximal side,
inducing a convexity of that side and movement away from
stimulus (negative curvature); this is followed by contraction
and concavity with normal positive curvature. The
interval between the A and D effects is increased with
increasing sub-tonicity of the specimen. But it nearly
vanishes when the excitability of the specimen is high,
and the two opposite reactions succeed each other too quickly
for the preliminary A reaction to become evident. It is
probable that in such a case the conflict between the two
opposite reactions prolongs the latent period. But in other
instances a preliminary expansive response is found to herald
the more pronounced contractile response. Example of this
is seen in figure 129 given in page 344.</p>

<p>The A effect was detected in the records referred to
above by its earlier appearance. Its longer persistence,
after moderate stimulation, is also to be found on the
cessation of moderate stimulation. This was seen in the
<i>acceleration</i> of growth which was the after-effect of
stimulation (Figs. 104, 115). The presence of two conflicting
physiological reactions is also made evident on sudden
cessation of long continued stimulation. This particular
phenomenon of "overshooting" will be more fully dealt
with in a subsequent chapter.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span></p>

<p>Owing to the difference in the time relations of the
two opposing activities, A and D, a phase difference often
arises in their respective maxima. It is probably on this
account that rhythmic tissues originally at standstill, exhibit
under continued stimulation a periodic up and down-movement,
which persists even on the cessation of the
stimulus. The persistence of after-oscillation depends, moreover,
on the intensity and duration of previous stimulation.<a name="FNanchor_A_18" id="FNanchor_A_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>The facts given above cannot be explained by the
prevalent theory that stimulus acts merely as a releasing
agent, to set free energy which had been previously
stored up by the organism, like the pull of a trigger
causing explosion of a charged cartridge. It is true that
in a highly excitable tissue, the external work performed
and the run down of energy are disproportionately
greater than the energy of stimulus that induces it. But
in a sub-tonic tissue, stimulus induces an effect which is
precisely the opposite; instead of a depletion, there is an
enhancement of potential energy of the system. Thus the
responding leaf instead of undergoing a fall becomes
erected; growing organs similarly exhibit a 'building up'
and an acceleration of rate of growth, in contrast with
the usual 'break down' and depression of the rate. It is
obvious that these new facts relating to the action of
stimulus necessitate a theory more comprehensive and
satisfactory than the one which has been in vogue.</p>


<h4>THE COMPLETE PHOTOTROPIC CURVE.</h4>

<p>I have explained the characteristics of the simple phototropic
curve in which the tropic curvature, on account of
the favourable tonic condition and strong intensity of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
incident light, was positive from the beginning, and in
which the curvature reached a maximum beyond which
there was no subsequent reversal. If the intensity of the
stimulus be feeble or moderate, the quantity of light incident
on the responding organ at the beginning may fall
below the critical value, and thus act as a sub-minimal
stimulus. This induces as we have seen (p. 344) a negative
tropic curvature; continued action of stimulus, however,
converts the preliminary negative into the usual positive.
The preliminary negative curvature may be detected
by the use of a moderately sensitive recorder with a magnification
of about 30 times. It is comparatively easy to
obtain the preliminary negative response in specimens
which are in a slightly sub-tonic condition.</p>

<p>Semi-conducting tissues exhibit under continued stimulation,
a neutralisation and reversal into negative (p. 331).
Since this reversal into negative usually takes place under
prolonged exposure to exceedingly strong light, it is difficult
to obtain in a single curve all the different phases
of transformation. I have, however, been fortunate in
obtaining a complete phototropic curve which exhibits in a
single specimen all the characteristic changes from a
preliminary negative to positive and subsequent reversal to
negative. I shall describe two such typical curves obtained
with the terminal leaflet of <i>Desmodium gyrans</i> and the
growing seedling of <i>Zea Mays</i>.</p>

<p><i>Complete phototropic curve of a pulvinated organ:
Experiment 135.</i>&mdash;A continuous record was taken of the
action of light of a 50 c. p. incandescent lamp, applied
on the upper half of the pulvinus of the terminal leaflet
of <i>Desmodium gyrans</i>. This gave rise: (1) to a negative
curvature (due to sub-minimal stimulus) which lasted for
3 minutes. The curve then proceeded upwards, at first
slowly, then rapidly; it then rounded off, and reached a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
maximum positive value in the course of 18 minutes;
after this the curve underwent a reversal, and complete
neutralisation occurred after a further period of 24 minutes
(Fig. 133). Beyond this the induced curvature is negative.</p>

</div>




<p><i>Complete phototropic curve of growing organs: Experiment
136.</i>&mdash;I obtained very similar effects by subjecting
the seedling of <i>Zea Mays</i> to unilateral light from an arc
lamp for two hours. The characteristic of this curve is
similar to that given by the terminal leaflet of <i>Desmodium
gyrans</i>. At the first stage, the sub-minimal stimulation
is seen to induce a negative curvature, transformed into
positive after an interval of 10 minutes. The maximum
positive curvature is reached after 50 minutes, and neutralisation
completed in a further period of 43 minutes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
(Fig. 134). After this the response became transformed
into negative.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 640px;">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 134.</span>&mdash;Complete phototropic curve of a growing organ (<i>Zea Mays</i>).</p>
</div>


<p>In a complete phototropic curve we may thus distinguish
4 distinct stages:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(1) The stage of sub-minimal stimulation.</p>

<p>(2) The stage of increasing positive curvature culminating
in a maximum.</p>

<p>(3) The stage of neutralisation.</p>

<p>(4) The stage of complete reversal into negative.</p></div>

<p>The curve thus crosses the zero line of the abscissa
twice; the first crossing takes places <i>upwards</i> at the
critical point of stimulation which demarcates the sub-minimal
from the minimal. The second crossing downwards
occurs beyond the point of complete neutralisation.</p>

<p>In a tissue in which transverse conductivity is absent,
and the stimulus applied from the beginning is above the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
minimal, the simple tropic curve is confined to the second
stage (see Fig. 132).</p>


<h4>WEBER'S LAW.</h4>

<p>If we neglect the preliminary negative portion under
sub-minimal stimulus, the curve of excitation under increasing
photic stimulation obeys what is known as Weber's law.
This is equally true of modes of stimulation other than
that of light as is seen in figure 130 of the contractile
effect of continued electric stimulus on growth; the excitatory
effect is also seen to reach a limit.</p>

<p>Weber's law is applicable for a limited range of stimulation.
For the quantitative relation fails in the region of
sub-minimal stimulus, where the physiological reaction is
<i>qualitatively</i> different, namely expansion instead of contraction.
This holds good even in the case of animal tissues,
for here also my recent experiments show that two opposite
reactions&mdash;expansion and contraction&mdash;take place under
stimulus, and that a very feeble stimulus tends to induce
expansion instead of contraction. The responsive reaction
of a kitten under gentle caressing strokes must be <i>qualitatively</i>
different from that of a blow. The psychological
effects under the two treatments evidently differ qualitatively
rather than quantitatively.<a name="FNanchor_A_19" id="FNanchor_A_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>


<h4>SUMMARY.</h4>

<p>The excitation curve exhibits a slow ascent in the
first part; in the second part the gradient is steep, indicating
rapid rise in excitation; in the third part it is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
uniform; and in the last part the curve rounds off and
the rate of ascent becomes very small.</p>

<p>The susceptibility for excitation is feeble at the beginning;
it increases very rapidly with increasing stimulus;
finally it undergoes a fall, increase of stimulus inducing
no further enhancement of excitation.</p>

<p>In a complete phototropic curve the first part is negative;
this is due to the physiological expansion induced by
sub-minimal stimulus. The curve then crosses the abscissa
upwards, and the positive curvature reaches a maximum.
This is followed by neutralisation and reversal into negative;
the curve crosses the zero line and proceeds in the
negative direction.</p>

<p>Weber's law is not applicable for the entire range of
stimulation. The quantitative relation fails in the region
of sub-minimal stimulus, where the physiological reaction
is <i>qualitatively</i> different.</p>

<p>Plant organs exhibit, as we have already seen, a heliotropic
curvature under direct stimulation. Still more interesting
is the transmitted effect of light giving rise to a curvature.
Thus if the tip of the seedling of wheat be exposed
to light, the excitation is transmitted lower down into
the region which acts as the responding organ. Growth
is very active in this particular zone, and the change of
growth, induced by the transmitted effect of stimulus, brings
about a curvature by which the tip of the seedling bends
towards light. The seedling thus appears to be differentiated
into three physiological zones subserving three different
functions. The tip is the perceptive zone, the intervening
distance between the tip and the growing region
is the zone of conduction, and the growing region is the
responsive zone. These differentiations are shown in a
striking manner by certain Paniceae, <i>Setaria</i> for example.
In this seedling the tapering sheathing leaf or cotyledon
is about 5 mm. in length, and it is the upper part
of the cotyledon that is most sensitive to light. Below
the sheathing leaf is a narrow length which will
be distinguished as the hypocotyl, and where growth is
very active. The apex of the leaf perceives the stimulus,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
and the effect is transmitted to the hypocotyl, which
responds by becoming curved so that the seedling bends
towards light.</p>

<p>It is necessary here to make special reference to the
confusion that arises from want of precision in the use
of the term stimulus, used indifferently to denote both the
cause and the resulting effect. An external agent, say
light, causes certain excitatory change in the tissue, and
we refer to the agent which induces it, as the <i>stimulus</i>.
Thus in the instance cited above, light is the <i>stimulus</i>,
and it is the stimulus-effect that is transmitted to a
distance. But in physiological literature no distinction
is made between the stimulus and its effect, hence arises
frequent use of the phrase 'transmission of stimulus'.
It is obvious that it is not light but its effect that is
transmitted.</p>

<p>Such want of precision in the use of the term stimulus
would not have seriously affected the truth about
the description of facts, had the transmitted effect been
only of one kind.  In a nerve-and-muscle preparation, the
velocity of transmission of excitation is so great, that it
completely masks the positive impulse (assuming the existence
of such an impulse). The effect of indirect stimulation
is, therefore, the same as that of direct stimulation.
Any indefiniteness in the use of the term stimulus
for its transmitted effect does not, in animal physiology,
seriously militate against the observed facts. But lack of
precision in the employment of the term in plant physiology
leads to hopeless confusion. For owing to the semi-conducting
nature of vegetable tissue, the transmitted effect
is not of a definite sign, but may be positive or negative;
in the first case, the response is by expansion, in the
latter, by contraction.  Thus the transmitted effect will be
very different in the two cases, according as the intervening
tissue is a good or a bad conductor. These facts<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
accentuate the urgent necessity of revision of our existing
terminology.</p>

<p>I have shown that the effects of other forms of stimuli
are also transmitted from the perceptive to the responding
region along the intervening path of conduction.
Thus the petiole of <i>Mimosa</i> perceive any form of stimulus
applied to it, and the induced excitation is conducted
to the distant pulvinus to evoke the familiar responsive
fall of the leaf. The pulvinus, moreover, perceives and
responds to direct stimulation. In a nerve-and-muscle
preparation the responding muscle is alike perceptive and
responsive.</p>

<p>But in <i>Setaria</i> we meet with certain characteristics of
reaction which are quite inexplicable. Thus if</p>

<p>"the seedling be illuminated on one side, a sharp
heliotropic curving takes place at the apex of hypocotyl.
The curvature makes itself apparent only if the cotyledon
be illuminated from one side whether the hypocotyl be
exposed to light or not. If the cotyledon be shaded and
the light be permitted to fall on one side of the hypocotyl,
no heliotropic curving takes place. Hence we may
conclude that it is only the cotyledon that is sensitive to
the light stimulus, and it is only the hypocotyl which can
carry out the movement. The excitation which the light
effects in the cotyledon must be transmitted to the hypocotyl
and curvature takes place only from such a transmitted
excitation. We have thus in this case a definite
organ for the perception of the stimulus of light, viz.,
the cotyledon, and as Rothert has shown, it is more
specially the apex of that organ that is the sensitive
part: on the other hand, the motile organ, the hypocotyl,
is some distance away from the sensitive organ, and in it
the power of perception is entirely absent. From the behaviour
of these organs we may draw the further conclusion that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
perception and heliotropic excitation are two distinct phenomena,
which depend on different properties of the protoplasm
and which are independent of each other....
We may, therefore, conclude from this experiment that these
two types of excitation are fundamentally distinct processes,
for it is only after indirect or transmitted and not
after direct excitation that a reaction occurs in the case
of the seedlings of the Paniceae".<a name="FNanchor_A_20" id="FNanchor_A_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>The noteworthy deductions on the above facts are:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(1) That the motile organ in <i>Setaria</i> is totally devoid
of perception, since direct action of light induces
no effect.</p>

<p>(2) That perception and heliotropic excitation are two
distinct phenomena, which depend on different
properties of the protoplasm, and which are
independent of each other.</p></div>

<p>Though the conclusions thus arrived at appear to follow
from the facts that have been observed, yet it is
difficult to accept the inference, that a responding organ
should be totally devoid of the power of perception, and
that excitation and perception are to be regarded as dependent
on different properties of protoplasm. It therefore
appeared necessary to re-investigate the subject of the
perceptive power of the cotyledon, and the responding
characteristics of the hypocotyl.</p>

<p>The criterion employed for test of perception is the
movement induced in response to stimulus. The responsive
<i>mechanical</i> movement is rendered possible only by the
contractility of the organ, and mechanical and anatomical
facilities offered by it for unhampered movement. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
petiole of <i>Mimosa</i> when locally stimulated does not itself
exhibit any movement. The fortunate circumstance of the
presence of a motile pulvinus in the neighbourhood enables
us to recognise the perceptive power of the petiole, since
it transmits an impulse which causes the fall of the leaf.
There is no motile pulvinus in ordinary leaves, and
stimulation of the petiole gives rise to no direct or transmitted
motile reaction; from this we are apt to draw the
inference that the petiole of ordinary leaves are devoid of
perception. This conclusion is, however, erroneous, since
under stimulus the petiole exhibits the electric response
characteristic of excitation. Moreover my electric investigations
have shown that every living tissue not only
perceives but also responds to stimulation.<a name="FNanchor_A_21" id="FNanchor_A_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Hence considerable
doubt may be entertained as regards the
supposed absence of perception in the hypocotyl of <i>Setaria</i>.</p>

<p>I shall in the present paper describe my investigations
on the mechanical response of <i>Setaria</i> under direct and
indirect stimulation which will be given in the following
order:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(1) The response to unilateral stimulation of the tip
of the seedling.</p>

<p>(2) The response of growing hypocotyl to direct stimulation.</p>

<p>(3) Summated effects of direct and indirect stimulation.</p></div>


<h4>EXPERIMENTAL ARRANGEMENTS.</h4>

<p><i>The Recorder.</i>&mdash;The pull exerted by the tropic curvature
of the seedling is very feeble; it was therefore
necessary to construct a very light and nearly balanced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
recording lever. A long glass fibre is supported by
lateral pivots on jewel bearings. The seedling is attached
to the short arm of the lever by means of a cocoon
thread. The recording plate oscillates to and fro once in
a minute; the successive dots give therefore the time
relations of the responsive movement. The positive curvature
towards light is recorded as an up-curve, the
negative curvature being represented by a down-curve.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Arrangement for local stimulation by light.</i>&mdash;The device
of placing tin foil caps on the tip employed by some
observers labours under the disadvantage, that it causes
mechanical irritation of the sensitive tip. The appliance
seen in figure 135 is free from this objection and offers
many advantages. A metallic screen has two holes
O and O'; these apertures are illuminated by a parallel
beam of light from an arc lamp. A lens focusses the
light from O, on the hypocotyl, and that from O', on the
tip of the cotyledon. A rectangular pivoted shutter S,
lies between the apertures O and O'. In the intermediate
position of the shutter, light acts on both the tip and the
growing region. The shutter is tilted up by a pull on
the thread T, thus cutting off light from the growing
region; release of the thread cuts off light from the tip.
Thus by proper manipulation of the shutter, the tip or the
growing hypocotyl, or both of them, may be subjected to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
the stimulus of light. The experiment was carried out
in a dark room, special precaution being taken that light
was screened off from the plant except at points of
localised stimulation.</p>

</div>



<h4>EFFECT OF LIGHT AT THE TIP OF THE ORGAN.</h4>

<p><i>Experiment 137.</i>&mdash;If the tip of the seedling of <i>Setaria</i>
be illuminated on one side, it is found that a <i>positive</i>
curvature (<i>i.e.</i>, towards light) is induced in the course
of an hour or more. But in obtaining record of the
seedling by unilateral stimulation of the tip, I found that
the immediate response was not towards, but away
from light (negative curvature). The latent period was
about 30 seconds and the negative movement continued
to increase for 25 minutes (Fig. 136). This result, hitherto<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
unsuspected, is not so anomalous as would appear at
first sight. Indirect stimulus, unilaterally applied, has
been shown to give rise to two impulses: a quicker
positive and a slower excitatory negative. The former
induces a convexity on the same side, and a movement
away from stimulus (negative curvature); the excitatory
negative, on the other hand, is conducted slowly and
induces contraction and concavity, and a movement towards
the stimulus (positive curvature). In semi-conducting or
non-conducting tissues, the excitatory negative is weakened
to extinction during transit, and the positive reaction
with negative curvature persists as the initial and final
effect.</p>

<p>But in <i>Setaria</i> the excitatory negative impulse is transmitted
along the parenchyma which is moderately conducting;
the speed of transmission of heliotropic excitation is,
according to Pfeffer, one or two mm. in five minutes or
about 0&middot;4 mm. per minute. Thus under the continued
action of light, the excitatory impulse will reach the growing
region, and by its predominant reaction neutralise and
reverse the previous negative curvature.</p>

<p>Inspection of figure 136 shows that this is what
actually took place; the intervening distance between the
tip of the cotyledon and the growing region in hypocotyl
was about 20 mm., and the beginning of reversal from
negative to positive curvature occurred 29 minutes after
application of light. The velocity of transmission of excitatory
impulse under strong light is thus 0&middot;7 mm. per
minute. The positive curvature continued to increase for
a very long time and became comparatively large. This
is for two reasons: (1) because the sensibility of the
tip of the cotyledon is very great, and (2) because the
positive curvature induced by longitudinally transmitted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
excitation is not neutralised by transverse conduction (see
below).</p>

induced positive phototropic curvature followed by neutralisation. Application
of indirect stimulus at dotted arrow on the tip gave rise at first to negative,
subsequently to positive curvature. (Seedling of <i>Setaria</i>).</p>
</div>



<h4>RESPONSE TO UNILATERAL STIMULUS IN THE GROWING
REGION.</h4>

<p><i>Experiment 138.</i>&mdash;The growing region of the hypocotyl
of <i>Setaria</i> is supposed to be totally devoid of the power
of perception. In order to subject the question to experimental
test, I applied unilateral light on the growing
region of the same specimen, after it had recovered from
the effect of previous stimulation. The response now obtained
was vigorous and was <i>ab-initio</i> positive. Direct
stimulus has thus induced the normal effect of contraction
and concavity of the excited side. The belief that the
hypocotyl of <i>Setaria</i> is incapable of perceiving stimulus
is thus without any foundation. The further experiment
which I shall presently describe will, however, offer an
explanation of the prevailing error. On continuing the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
action of unilateral light, the positive curvature after
attaining a maximum in the course of 15 minutes, underwent
a diminution and final neutralisation (Fig. 137). On
account of this neutralisation the seedling became erect after
an exposure of 30 minutes; in contrast with this is the
increasing positive curvature under unilateral illumination of
the tip (Fig. 136) which continues for several hours. The
explanation of this neutralisation under direct stimulation
of the growing region is found in the fact that transverse
conduction of excitation induces contraction at the distal side
of the organ and thus nullifies the positive curvature. The
seeming absence of tropic effect under direct stimulation
is thus not due to want of perception, but to balanced
antagonistic reactions on opposite sides of the organ.</p>


<h4>EFFECT OF SIMULTANEOUS STIMULATION OF THE TIP
AND THE HYPOCOTYL.</h4>

<p>Though stimulation of the hypocotyl results in neutralisation,
yet the illumination of one side of the organ
including the tip and hypocotyl is found to give rise to
positive curvature. This will be understood from the
following experiment.</p>

<p>After the neutralisation in the last experiment light was
also applied to the tip from the right side at the dotted
arrow (Fig. 137). The record shows that this gave rise
at first to a negative curvature (away from light); under
the continued action of light, however, the negative was
subsequently reversed to a positive curvature, towards light.
Inspection of the curve shows another interesting fact.
The positive curvature induced by direct stimulation is very
much less than that brought out by indirect stimulation.
This is due to two reasons: (1) the sensitiveness of the
tip of the organ is, as is well known, greater than that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
of the hypocotyl, (2) the positive curvature under direct
stimulation cannot proceed very far, since it is neutralised
by transverse conduction of excitation.</p>

<p>It will be seen from the above that the illumination
of the tip practically inhibits the neutralisation and thus
restores the normal positive curvature. The question now
arises as to how this particular inhibition is brought
about.</p>


<h4>ALGEBRAICAL SUMMATION OF THE EFFECTS OF DIRECT
AND INDIRECT STIMULATIONS.</h4>

<p>An instance of inhibition, though of a different kind,
was noticed in the response of the tendril of <i>Passiflora</i>
(p. 296); the under side of the organ is highly sensitive,
while the upper side is almost insensitive. Stimulation
of the under side of the tendril induces a marked curvature,
but simultaneous stimulation of the diametrically
opposite side inhibits the response. This neutralisation
could not be due to the antagonistic contraction of the
upper side since the irritability of that side is very slight.
I have shown that the inhibition results from the two
antagonistic reactions, contraction at the proximal side due
to direct stimulation and expansion caused by the positive
impulse from the indirectly stimulated distal side.</p>

<p>We have in the above an algebraical summation of the
effects of direct and indirect stimulations. The longitudinally
transmitted effect of indirect stimulus in <i>Setaria</i>
may, likewise, be summated with the effect of direct stimulus.
The phenomenon of algebraical summation is
demonstrated in a very striking and convincing manner
in the following experiment, which I have been successful
in devising.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Experiment 139.</i>&mdash;I have explained, (Expt. 126) that unilateral
application of stimulus of light on the upper half of
the responding pulvinus of <i>Mimosa</i> induces an up or positive
curvature, followed by a neutralisation and even a reversal
into negative, the last two effects being brought about
by transverse conduction of excitation to the distal side.
When the incident light is of moderate intensity, the transmitted
excitation only suffices to induce neutralisation
without further reversal into negative; while in this state
of balanced neutralisation let us apply indirect stimulus
by throwing light on the stem at a point directly opposite
to the leaf (Fig. 138).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 640px;">

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 138.</span>&mdash;(<i>a</i>) Diagrammatic representation of direct application of light (&#8595;)

effect of direct stimulus, positive curvature followed by neutralisation. Superposition
of the positive reaction of indirect stimulus induces erectile up-response
followed by down movement due to transmitted excitatory impulse (<i>Mimosa</i>).</p>
</div>

<p>Two different impulses are thus initiated from the effect
of indirect stimulus.  In the present case the positive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
reached the responding pulvinus after 30 seconds and
induced an erectile movement of the leaf; the excitatory
negative impulse reached the organ 4 minutes later and
caused a rapid fall of the leaf. The record (Fig. 138)
shows further that the previous action of direct stimulus
which brought about neutralisation, does not interfere with
the effects of indirect stimulus. The individual effects of
direct and indirect stimulus are practically independent
of each other; hence their joint effects exhibit algebraical
summation.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 280px;">

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 139.</span>&mdash;Diagrammatic representation of the effects of direct and indirect
stimulus on the response of <i>Setaria</i>. Direct stimulation, represented by thick
arrow gives rise to antagonistic concavities of opposite sides of responding
hypocotyl, resulting in neutralisation.</p>

<p>Indirect stimulus represented by dotted arrow gives rise to two impulses,
the quick positive impulse represented by a circle, and the slower negative
impulse represented by crescent (concave).</p>
</div>

<p>We are now in a position to have a complete understanding
of the characteristic response of Paniceae to
transmitted phototropic excitation.</p>

<p>(1) Local stimulation of the tip gives rise to two impulses,
positive and negative. The former induces a transient
negative movement (away from light); the latter causes
a permanent and increasing positive curvature towards
light.</p>

<p>(2) Local stimulation of the growing hypocotyl gives
rise to positive curvature, subsequently neutralised by the
transverse conduction of excitation to the distal side. The
absence of tropic effect in the growing region is thus due
not to lack of power of perception, but to balanced antagonistic
reactions of two opposite sides of the organ.</p>

<p>(3) The effects of direct and indirect stimulations are
independent of each other; hence, on simultaneous stimulations
of the tip and the growing hypocotyl, the effects of
indirect stimulus are algebraically summated with the
effect of direct stimulus (neutralisation). The indirect
stimulation of the tip on the right side gives rise to
two impulses, of which the expansive positive reached
the right side of the responding region earlier, inducing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
convexity and movement away from stimulus (negative
curvature). This is diagrammatically shown in Fig. 139.
Had the intervening tissue been non-conducting, the
slow excitatory negative impulse would have failed
to reach the responding region, and the negative
curvature induced by the positive impulse would
prove to be the initial as well as the final effect.
In the case of <i>Setaria</i>, however, the excitatory
impulse reaches the right side of the organ after
the positive impulse; the final effect is therefore
an induced concavity and positive curvature
(movement towards stimulus).</p>


<p>The results given above enable us to draw the following
generalisations:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. In an organ, the tip of which is highly excitable,
the balanced state of neutralisation, induced by direct
stimulation of the responding region, is upset in two
different ways by two impulses generated in consequence of
indirect stimulation at the tip. Hence arises two types of
resultant response:&mdash;</p>

<p>Type A.&mdash;If the intervening tissue be semi-conducting,
the positive impulse alone will reach the growing region
and induce convexity of the same side of the organ
giving rise to a <i>negative</i> curvature.</p>

<p>Type B.&mdash;If the intervening tissue be conducting the
transmission of the excitatory impulse will finally give
rise to a <i>positive</i> curvature.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span></p>

<p>Type B is exemplified by the seedling of <i>Setaria</i> where
the transmission of excitatory impulse from the tip upsets
the neutral balance and induces the final positive curvature.</p>

<p>Example of type A is found in the negative phototropism
of the root of <i>Sinapis</i>.</p>

<p><i>Negative phototropism of root of</i> Sinapis: <i>Experiment
140.</i>&mdash;For investigation of the negative phototropism of
the root of <i>Sinapis nigra</i> I took record of its movement
under unilateral action of light by means of a Recording
Microscope, devised for the purpose.<a name="FNanchor_A_22" id="FNanchor_A_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> When the root-tip
alone was stimulated by unilateral light, the root moved
away from the source of light. This was due to the
longitudinal transmission of positive impulse to the growing
region at some distance from the tip. The intervening
distance between the tip and the growing region is practically
non-conducting, hence the excitatory impulse could
not be conducted from the tip. After a period of rest in
darkness, I next took record of its movement under
direct unilateral illumination of the growing region; the
result was at first a positive movement; but this, on
account of transverse conduction of excitation under
continued stimulation, underwent a neutralisation and
slight reversal. In taking a third record, in which both
the tip and growing region were simultaneously subjected
to unilateral stimulation of light, I found that a resultant
responsive movement was induced which was away
from light.</p>

<p>Thus in the root of <i>Sinapis</i>, the expansive effect of
indirect stimulation of the tip is superposed on that of
direct stimulation of the growing region (neutral or slightly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
negative). The final result is thus a movement away
from light or a <i>negative</i> phototropic curvature.</p>


<h4>SUMMARY.</h4>

<p>The effect induced by stimulus of light is transmitted
to a distance, in a manner precisely the same as in
other modes of stimulation.</p>

<p>In the Paniceae, the local unilateral stimulation of the
tip of the cotyledon induces positive curvature in the
growing hypocotyl, at some distance from the tip. This is
due to transmitted excitatory effect of indirect stimulation;
the earlier positive impulse induces a preliminary negative
curvature, which is reversed later by the excitatory negative
impulse into positive curvature.</p>

<p>Contrary to generally accepted view the hypocotyl not
only perceives but responds to light. The positive curvature
induced by direct stimulation is, however, neutralised
by transverse conduction of excitation.</p>

<p>The effects of direct and indirect stimulus are independent
of each other; the final effect is determined by
their algebraical summation.</p>

<p>Phototropic response, positive or negative, is determined
by the directive action of light. But photonastic reaction
is supposed to belong to a different class of phenomenon,
where the movement is independent of the directive action
of light. I shall, however, be able to establish a continuity
between the tropic response of a radial and the nastic
movement of a dorsiventral organ. The intermediate link
is supplied by organs originally radial, but subsequently
rendered anisotropic by the unilateral action of stimulus of
the environment. In a dorsiventral organ, owing to anatomico-physiological
differentiation, the responsive movement
is constrained to take place in a direction perpendicular to
the plane of separation of the two unequally excitable
halves of the organ. Even in such a case, it will be shown,
that light does exert a directive action; the direction of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
movement will further be shown to be distorted by the
lateral action of light.</p>


<h4>PHOTOTROPIC RESPONSE OF ANISOTROPIC ORGANS.</h4>

<p>The different sides of a radial organ, such as the young
stem of <i>Mimosa</i>, are equally excitable. The response to
unilateral light of moderate intensity is therefore positive;
owing to equal excitabilities of the two sides the response
of the opposite sides are alike. Diffuse stimulation therefore
induces no resultant curvature. If, however, the plant is
allowed to form a creeping habit, the excitabilities of the
dorsal and ventral sides will no longer remain the same.
Thus in the creeping stem of <i>Mimosa</i> the lower or the
shaded side is, generally speaking, found to be the more
excitable. In fact such anisotropic stem of <i>Mimosa</i> acts
somewhat like the pulvinus of the same plant. Diffuse
stimulation induces, in both, a concavity of the more
excitable lower half with the down movement of the leaf
or the stem.</p>

<p><i>Experiment 141.</i>&mdash;I took four creeping stems of <i>Mimosa</i>
in vigorous condition and tied them in such a manner that
their free ends should be vertical. The shaded sides of the
four specimens were so turned that each faced a different
point of the compass&mdash;east, west, north and south. Subjected
thus to diffuse stimulus of light from the sky, they all
executed curvatures. The specimen whose under side faced
the east, became bent towards the east; the same happened
to those which faced north, south, and west, that is to
say they curved towards the north, south, and west respectively
(Fig. 140). The fundamental action by which all
these were determined was the induced concavity of the
under or normally shaded side, which was the more excitable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>.
I obtained similar results with various other creeping
stems.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 800px;">

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 140.</span>&mdash;Photonastic curvature of creeping stem of <i>Mimosa pudica</i>: in the
central figure the stem is seen to be vertical: action of diffuse light induced
appropriate curvatures by greater contraction and concavity of the more excitable
lower or shaded side, as seen in figures to the right (<i>b</i>) and left (<i>c</i>).</p>
</div>


<p>It has been shown that under prolonged unilateral
stimulation, excitation becomes internally diffused; this
gives rise to an effect similar to that of external diffuse
stimulus. Under strong light the shaded side becomes
concave, and thus press against the ground or the support;
this will be the characteristic response of creeping stems in
which the shaded side is the more excitable. The facts
given above will probably explain the response of midribs
of leaves, of the creeping stem of <i>Lysimachia</i>, all of
which, in response to the action of strong light acting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
from above, exhibit concavity of the shaded and more
excitable side.</p>


<h4>PARA-HELIOTROPISM.</h4>

<p>Under strong sunlight, the leaflets of various plants move
sometimes upwards, at other times downwards, so as to
place the blades of leaflets parallel to incident light. This
'midday sleep' has been termed <i>para-heliotropism</i> by
Darwin. It has been thought that para-heliotropic action
has nothing to do with the directive action of light,
since many leaflets either fold upwards or downwards,
irrespective of the direction of incident light. I shall
for convenience distinguish the leaflets which fold upwards
under light as <i>positively</i> para-heliotropic, and those which
fold downwards as <i>negatively</i> para-heliotropic. This is
merely for convenience of description. There is no specific
irritability which distinguishes one from the other.</p>


<h4>POSITIVE PARA-HELIOTROPISM.</h4>

<p><i>Para-heliotropic response of</i> Erythrina indica <i>and of</i>
Clitoria ternatea: <i>Experiment 142.</i>&mdash;For the purpose of simplicity
I have described the type of movement of these
leaflets as upwards; but the actual direction in which the
leaflets point their apices is towards the sun. Both the
plants mentioned here are so remarkably sensitive that
the leaflets follow the course of the sun, in such a way
that the axis of the cup, formed by the folding leaflets
at the end and the sides of the petiole, is coincident with
the rays of light. The pulvinus makes a sharp curvature
which is concave to light, the blade of the leaflet
being parallel to light. I have taken record of continuous
action of strong light acting on the responding pulvinus
of the leaflets from above. The result is an increasing
positive curvature which reached a limit (Fig. 141). There<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
was no neutralisation or reversal, demonstrating the absence

</div>

<p><i>Para-heliotropic movement of leaflets of</i> Mimosa pudica:
<i>Experiment 143.</i>&mdash;These leaflets, as previously stated, fold
themselves upwards, when strongly illuminated either from
above or below. Diffuse electric stimulation also induce a
closing movement upwards; hence the upper half of the
pulvinule of these leaflets are the more excitable. In order
to obtain a continuous record of the leaflet under the
action of unilateral light, I constructed a very delicate
recording lever magnifying about 150 times. Light of
moderate intensity from a 100 candle-power incandescent
lamp was applied on the less excitable lower side of the
pulvinule. The record (Fig. 142) shows that the immediate
response is positive, or a movement towards the light.
But owing to transverse conduction, through the thin and
highly conducting pulvinule, the response was quickly
reversed into a very pronounced negative, or movement
away from light. Had a delicate means of obtaining
magnified record not been available, the slight positive
twitch, and the gradual transition from positive to negative
phototropic curvature would have passed unnoticed.
Application of light from above gave, on account of the
greater excitability of the upper half of the pulvinule, a
pronounced positive response or movement towards light.
The anomaly of an identical organ appearing as positively
heliotropic when acted by light from above, and negatively<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
heliotropic when acted from below, is now fully removed.
The response of the leaflets is also seen to be determined
by the directive action of light, though the short-lived
response of the less excitable lower side is quickly masked
by the predominant reaction of the more excitable upper
side of the organ.</p>

<h4>NEGATIVE PARA-HELIOTROPISM.</h4>

<p><i>Response of leaflet of</i> Averrhoa carambola: <i>Experiment
144.</i>&mdash;The leaflets of this plant, and also those of <i>Biophytum
sensitivum</i> fold downwards under action of strong light,
applied above or below. In these leaflets diffuse electric
stimulation induce a fall of the leaflets demonstrating the
greater excitability of the lower half of the pulvinule. The
analysis of reaction under light is rendered possible from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
the record of response of leaflet of <i>Averrhoa</i>, given in Fig.
143. Light of moderate intensity from an incandescent
electric lamp acted from above: the result was a feeble and
short-lived positive response, quickly reversed to strong
negative by transmission of excitation to the more excitable
lower side. Illumination from below gave rise only to
strong positive response. Thus in <i>Averrhoa</i> the effect of
continuous light applied above or below is a downward
movement; in <i>Mimosa</i> the movement is upwards. The
explanation of this difference lies in the fact, that in
<i>Mimosa</i> leaflet it is the upper half of the pulvinule that
is more excitable; while in <i>Averrhoa</i> and in <i>Biophytum</i>
the lower is the more excitable half of the organ.</p>

<p>As a summary of the tropic action of light I shall give
diagrammatic representations of various types of phototropic
response, including the photonastic (Fig. 144). The direction
of the arrow indicates the direction of incident light.
Dotted specimens are those which possess transverse conductivity.
Thick lines represent the more excitable side of an anisotropic
or dorsiventral organ. The size of the circles, with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
positive and  negative signs, represents the amplitude
and sign of curvature.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>a.</i> Radial thick organ, in which transverse conduction
is absent. Curvature is <i>positive</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, movement towards
light. The result will be similar when light
strikes in an opposite direction, <i>i.e.</i>, from right
to left.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> Radial thin organ. There is here a possibility of
transverse conduction. Sequence of curvature:
<i>positive</i>, <i>neutral</i>, and <i>negative</i>. Reversal of
direction of light gives rise to similar sequence
of responses as before (<i>e.g.</i>, seedling of <i>Sinapis</i>).</p>

<p><i>c.</i> Anisotropic thick organ; transverse conduction
possible. Thick line represents the more excitable
distal side. Sequence of curvature: positive,
neutral and pronounced negative. When light
strikes from opposite direction on the more
excitable side the curvature will remain positive,
since the pronounced reaction of the more excitable
side cannot be neutralised or reversed by
transmitted excitation to the less excitable distal
side (<i>e.g.</i>, leaf of <i>Mimosa</i>).</p>

<p><i>In the absence of transverse conduction</i>, the curvature
remains positive (<i>e.g.</i>, leaflet of <i>Erythrina</i>).</p>

<p><i>d.</i> Anisotropic thin organ with high transverse conductivity.

quickly masked by predominant negative.
Light striking on the more excitable side will
give rise only to <i>positive</i>. The response in relation
to the plant, will apparently be in the same
direction whether light strikes the organ on one
side or the opposite (<i>e.g.</i>, leaflets of <i>Mimosa</i>,

an acceleration of the rate of growth under stimulus (p. 224)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
the corresponding tropic reaction would therefore be away
from stimulus or <i>negative</i> curvature. The tonic condition
is, however, raised to the normal by the action of stimulus
itself, and the tropic curvature becomes positive.</p>

<h4>SUMMARY.</h4>

<p>There is no line of demarcation between tropic and
nastic movements.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span></p>

<p>In a differentially excitable organ the effect of strong
unilateral stimulus becomes internally diffused, and causes
greater contraction of the more excitable side of the
organ.</p>

<p>In the absence of transverse conduction, the positive
curvature reaches a maximum without neutralisation or
reversal. The leaflets of <i>Erythrina indica</i> and of
<i>Clitoria ternatea</i> thus fold upwards, the apices of the
leaflets pointing towards the sun.</p>

<p>Internally diffused excitation under strong light induces
greater contraction of the more excitable half of the
pulvinule, causing upward folding of <i>Mimosa</i> leaflet, and
downward folding of the leaflets of <i>Biophytum</i> and
<i>Averrhoa</i>.</p>

CURVATURE</h2>

<br /><i>Assisted by</i><br />

<br /><span class="smcap">Guruprasanna Das.</span></h3>


<p>I shall in this chapter deal with certain anomalies in
phototropic curvature, brought about by variation of temperature
and by seasonal change; certain organs again
are apparently erratic in their phototropic response.</p>


<h4>SEASONAL CHANGE OF PHOTOTROPIC ACTION.</h4>

<p>Sachs observed a positive phototropic curvature in the
stems of <i>Trop&aelig;olum majus</i> in autumn; but this was
reversed into negative in summer; similarly in the
hypocotyl of Ivy, the positive curvature in autumn is
converted into negative curvature in summer.</p>

<p>Certain organs are apparently insensitive to the action
of light. Thus no phototropic response is found in the
tendril of <i>Passiflora</i> even under the action of strong
light. The tendrils of <i>Vitis</i> and <i>Ampelopsis</i> exhibit,
according to Wiesner, positive phototropism under feeble,
and negative phototropism under strong light.</p>

<p>The anomalies referred to above may be explained by
taking into consideration the modifying influence of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
temperature on the excitability, and the conductivity of
the organ.</p>


<h4>EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE ON EXCITABILITY.</h4>

<p>The excitability of an organ is abolished at a low
temperature; it is enhanced by a rise of temperature up
to an optimum. The temperature minimum and optimum
varies in different tissues. The following table shows
the enhancement of excitability of <i>Mimosa</i> at different
temperatures, the testing stimulus being the same.</p>

<p class="tabcap">TABLE XXXII&mdash;SHOWING VARIATION OF EXCITABILITY OF PULVINUS OF
<i>Mimosa</i> AT DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES.</p>

<div class='center'>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="" rules="cols">
<tr><td class='bbox'>Temperature.</td><td class='bbox'>Amplitude of response.</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>22&deg;C.</td><td align='left'>  &nbsp; 2 divisions.</td></tr>

<tr><td align='left'>32&deg;C.</td><td align='left'> 36 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Below 20&deg;C. the excitability of the pulvinus of <i>Mimosa</i>
is practically abolished. The excitability increases till an
optimum temperature is reached, above which it undergoes
a decline.</p>

<p>Though rise of temperature enhances excitability up
to an optimum, there is an antagonistic reaction induced
by it which opposes the excitatory contraction. The
physiological reaction of a rise of temperature, within
normal range, is expansion and this must oppose the
contraction induced by stimulus. Hence the effect of
rise of temperature is complex; it enhances the excitability
which favours contraction, while tending to oppose
this contraction by the induced physiological expansion.
As a result of these opposite reactions there will be a
critical temperature, below which the contractile effect<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
will relatively be greater than expansion; above the
critical point, expansion will be the predominant effect.
The critical temperature will obviously be different in
different organs. The positive curvature may thus be
increased by a slight rise, while it may be neutralised, or
even reversed by a greater rise of temperature.</p>

<p>The induced variation of excitability due to change of
temperature is not the only factor in modifying tropic
curvature, for variation of conductivity also exerts a
marked effect.</p>


<h4>EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE ON CONDUCTION.</h4>

<p>The conducting power of an organ is greatly enhanced
with rise of temperature. Thus in <i>Mimosa</i> the velocity of
transmission of excitation is doubled by a rise of temperature
through 9&deg;C. (p. 100). An organ which is practically
non-conducting at a low temperature will become conducting
at a higher temperature.</p>

<p>Thus at a low temperature the organ may be non-conducting,
and the excitatory contraction under unilateral
stimulus will remain localised at the proximal side; this
will give rise to a positive curvature. But under rising
temperature, the power of transverse conduction will be
increased and the excitation will be conducted to the
distal side. The result of this will be a neutralisation or
reversal into negative curvature (p. 139). A positive
curvature is thus reversed into negative by change of
excitability and conductivity, induced by rise of temperature;
examples of this will be given presently.</p>


<h4>PHOTOTROPIC RESPONSE OF TENDRILS.</h4>

<p>I shall here adduce considerations which will show that
the apparent anomalies regarding the response of tendrils<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
to light is due to the variation of transverse conductivity of
the organ. In a semi-conducting tissue, while the excitatory
effect of feeble stimulus remains localised at the proximal
side, the effect of stronger stimulus is conducted to the distal
side. This explains the positive phototropic curvature of
tendrils of <i>Vitis</i> and <i>Ampelopsis</i> under feeble light, and
its reversal into negative curvature under intense light.</p>

<p>As the conducting power is increased with rise of temperature
it is evident that at a certain temperature the
tropic effect will be exactly neutralised by transverse conduction.
Lowering of temperature, by reducing the transmission
of excitation to the distal side, will restore the
positive curvature. Enhancement of conduction under rise
of temperature will, on the other hand, increase the antagonistic
reaction of the distal side and give rise to
a negative curvature.</p>

<p>I shall in verification of the above, describe experiments
which I have carried out on the phototropic response of
the tendril of <i>Passiflora</i>, supposed to be insensitive to
the action of light.</p>

<p><i>Phototropic response of the tendril of</i> Passiflora:
<i>Experiment 145.</i>&mdash;The tendril was cooled by keeping it
for a long time in a cold chamber, maintained at 15&deg;C.
The effect of unilateral light on the cooled specimen was
found to be positive; the tendril was next allowed to
assume the temperature of the room which was 30&deg;C.
The response was now found to have undergone a change
into negative. The positive and negative phototropic
curvatures of an identical organ at different temperatures is
seen in the two records given in figure 145. Neutralisation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
takes place at an intermediate temperature, and the organ
thus appears insensitive to light.</p>

of <i>Passiflora</i> at 15&deg;C.; (<i>b</i>) negative
phototropic curvature at 30&deg;C.</p>
</div>

<h4>SEASONAL VARIATION OF PHOTOTROPIC CURVATURE.</h4>

<p>Reference has been made of the phototropic curvature
of <i>Trop&aelig;olum</i> and of Ivy undergoing a change from
positive in autumn to negative in summer. The experiment
described above shows that rise of temperature, by
enhancing transverse conductivity, transforms the positive
into negative heliotropic curvature. The reversal of the
phototropic curvature of <i>Trop&aelig;olum</i> and Ivy, from positive
in autumn to negative in summer, finds a probable explanation
in the higher temperature condition of the latter
season. This inference finds independent support from the
fact previously described (p. 100) that while the velocity of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
conduction of excitation in the petiole of <i>Mimosa</i> is as
high as 30 mm. per second in summer, it is reduced to
about 4 mm. in late autumn and early winter.</p>


<h4>ANTAGONISTIC EFFECTS OF LIGHT AND OF RISE
OF TEMPERATURE.</h4>

<p>I have explained the complex effect of rise of temperature
on phototropic curvature. Rise of temperature, within
limits, enhances the excitability, and therefore the positive
curvature under light. Its expansive reaction, on the other
hand, opposes the contraction of the proximal side, which
produces the normal positive curvature. Rise of temperature,
as previously stated, introduces another element of
variation by its effect on conductivity. Transverse conduction
favoured by rise of temperature promotes neutralisation
and reversal; the resultant effect will thus be very
complicated. I give below account of an experiment where
the induced positive curvature under light underwent a
reversal during rise of temperature.</p>

<p><i>Reversal of tropic curvature under rise of temperature:
Experiment 146.</i>&mdash;The specimen employed for this experiment
was a seedling of pea, enclosed in a glass chamber, the
temperature of which could be gradually raised by means of
an electric heater. Provisions were made to maintain the
chamber in a humid condition. The temperature of the
chamber was originally at 29&deg;C., and application of light on
one side of the organ gave rise to positive curvature, followed
by complete recovery on the cessation of light (Fig. 146a).
The next experiment was carried out with the same specimen;
while the plant was undergoing increasing positive curvature
under the continued action of light, the temperature of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
chamber was gradually raised from 29&deg; to 33&deg;C. at the point
marked with arrow. It will be seen that the positive curvature
became arrested, neutralised, and finally reversed into negative
(Fig. 146b).</p>

positive curvature followed by recovery, (<i>b</i>) reversal of positive into negative
curvature by rise of temperature at (H). (Pea seedling).</p>
</div>

<p><i>After-effect of rise of temperature: Experiment 147.</i>&mdash;The
after-effect of rise of temperature exhibited by this specimen
was extremely curious. The temperature of the chamber was
allowed to return to the normal, and the experiment repeated
after an hour; the response was now found to be negative
(Fig. 147a). It appeared probable that the temperature in the
interior of the tissue had not yet returned to the normal, and
an interval of four hours was therefore allowed for the restoration
of the tissue to the normal temperature of the room.
The response still persisted to be negative, as seen in the series of
records obtained under successive stimulations of light of short
duration; these negative responses exhibited recovery on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
cessation of light (Fig. 147b). This reversal of response as an
after-effect of rise of temperature was in this case found to
persist for several hours. I experimented with the same specimen
next day when the response was found restored to the
normal positive.</p>

<h4>SUMMARY.</h4>

<p>Rise of temperature, within limits, enhances the general
excitability of the organ. This has the effect of increasing
positive phototropic curvature. But the physiological expansion
induced by rise of temperature exerts an antagonistic
effect.</p>

<p>The transverse conductivity is increased with the rise of
temperature; this favours neutralisation and reversal of phototropic
curvature.</p>

<p>Tendrils of <i>Passiflora</i>, supposed to be phototropically
insensitive, exhibit positive curvature at low, and negative curvature
at a moderately high temperature.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span></p>

<p>The change of phototropic curvature exhibited by
<i>Trop&aelig;olum majus</i> and Ivy, from positive in autumn to
negative in summer, is probably due to the effect of temperature.
Higher temperature with enhanced transverse
conductivity in summer, may thus convert positive into
negative curvature.</p>

<p>The physiological effects of rise of temperature and the
stimulus of light are antagonistic to each other.</p>

<p>Rise of temperature tends to neutralise or reverse the
positive phototropic curvature. The after-effect of temperature
is often very persistent.</p>

<p>In addition to positive or negative curvatures light
induces a responsive torsion.  With regard to this Jost
says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The mechanics of the torsions have not as yet been fully
explained. It has long been believed that these torsions were
occasioned only by the action of a series of external factors,
such as light, gravity, weight of the organ which individually
led to curvatures, but in combination induced torsions; but
later investigations have shown that torsions might appear
when light only was the functional external factor.... If the
torsions cannot generally be regarded as due to the combination
of two curvatures, we are completely in the dark as to the
mechanics of their production."<a name="FNanchor_A_23" id="FNanchor_A_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>A leaf when struck laterally by light undergoes a twist, so
that the upper surface is placed, more or less, at right angles to
the incident rays; as no explanation was available for this
movement, the suggestion has been made that the particular
reaction is for the advantage of the plant. I shall presently
show, that it is possible to reverse this normal torsion and
thus make the upper surface of the leaf move away from
light.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span></p>

<p>The experiments which I shall presently describe will,
it is hoped, throw light on the obscure phenomenon. I shall
be able to show:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(1) that the torsional response is not dependent on the
combination of two curvatures,</p>

<p>(2) that it is also independent of the effect of weight,</p>

<p>(3) that it may be induced not merely by stimulus of
light but by all forms of stimulation,</p>

<p>(4) that the direction of the torsional response depends
on the direction of the incident stimulus and the
differential excitability of the organ, and</p>

<p>(5) that there is a definite law which determines the
torsional movement.</p></div>


<h4>EXPERIMENTAL ARRANGEMENTS.</h4>

<p>I shall first describe a typical experiment on the responsive
torsion under the action of light. We have seen that in the
pulvinus of <i>Mimosa</i>, light of moderate intensity and of short
duration applied on the upper half induces a slow up-movement,
while the stimulus of light applied below induces a more
rapid down-movement. The difference is due to the fact that
the lower half of the pulvinus is relatively the more excitable.
Vertical light thus induces a movement in a vertical plane.
But an interesting variation is induced in the response under
the action of lateral light. A stimulus will be called <i>lateral</i>
when it acts on either the right or left flank of a <i>dorsiventral</i>
organ. We shall presently find that a dorsiventral organ
responds to lateral stimulus by torsion.</p>

<p>The present series of experiments were carried out with the
leaf of <i>Mimosa</i>, and in order to eliminate the effect of weight
and also for obtaining record of pure torsion, I employed the
following device. The petiole was enclosed in a hooked
support made of thin rod of glass, the petiole resting on the
concavity of the smooth surface. Friction and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
effect of weight is thus practically eliminated; the looped
support prevented up or down movements, and yet allowed
perfect freedom for torsional response. This latter is magnified
by a piece of stout aluminium wire fixed at right angles to the
petiole (Fig. 148). The end of the aluminium wire is attached
to the short arm of a recording lever; there is thus a compound
magnification of the torsional movement. The Oscillating
Recorder gave successive dots at intervals which could be
varied from 20 seconds to 2 minutes. Time-relations of the
response may thus be obtained from the dotted record.</p>

</div>


<p>With the experimental device just described, we shall be in a
position to study the effect of various stimuli applied at one
flank of the pulvinus&mdash;at the junction of the upper and lower
halves of the organ. The observer standing in front of the
leaf is supposed to look at the stem. Torsional response will
then appear as a movement either with or against the hands of
the clock. The torsional response, right-handed or left-handed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
will presently be shown to depend on the direction of incident
stimulus. In figure 149, anti-clockwise torsion is recorded
as an up-curve; clockwise rotation is recorded as a down-curve.</p>


<h4>ACTION OF STIMULUS OF LIGHT.</h4>

<p><i>Experiment 148.</i>&mdash;The pulvinus of the leaf was stimulated
by a horizontal beam of light thrown in a lateral
direction; the areas contiguous to line of junction of the
upper and lower halves of the anisotropic organ thus underwent
differential excitation. When light struck on the left
flank, the responsive torsion was anti-clockwise; the responsive
reaction thus made <i>the upper and the less excitable
half of the pulvinus face the stimulus</i>. Figure 149 gives a
record of the torsional movement when light struck the
left flank of the organ; on the cessation of stimulus the
response is followed by recovery.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 149.</span>&mdash;Record of torsional response of pulvinus of <i>Mimosa pudica</i>.</p>
</div>


<h4>DIRECTIVE ACTION OF STIMULUS.</h4>

<p><i>Experiment 149.</i>&mdash;If now the direction of stimulus be
changed so that light strikes on the right flank instead<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>
of the left, the responsive torsion is found to be reversed,
the direction of movement being clockwise. Here also the
responsive movement is such that it is the less excitable
upper half of the organ that is made to face the stimulus.
It will thus be seen that the torsion, anti-clockwise or
clockwise, depends on two factors, namely the direction of
stimulus, and the differential excitability of the organ.</p>


<h4>EFFECT OF DIFFERENT MODES OF LATERAL STIMULATION.</h4>

<p>I shall now proceed to show that the torsional response
is induced not merely by the action of light, but by all
forms of stimulation.</p>

<p><i>Effect of chemical stimulation: Experiment 150.</i>&mdash;Dilute
hydrochloric acid was at first applied on the left flank
of the pulvinus along the narrow strip of junction of
the upper and lower halves. This gave rise to a responsive
torsion against the hands of a clock. Chemical
stimulation of the right flank induced, on the other hand,
a torsional movement with the hands of a clock. Here
also the direction of stimulus is found to determine the
direction of responsive torsion.</p>

<p><i>Effect of thermal radiation: Experiment 151.</i>&mdash;I next
employed thermal radiation as the stimulus; the source of
radiation was a length of electrically heated platinum
wire. It is advisable to interpose a narrow horizontal
slit, so as to localise the stimulus at the junction of the
upper and lower halves of the pulvinus. Stimulus applied
at the left flank induced left-handed or anti-clockwise
torsion; application at the right flank gave rise to right-handed
torsion.</p>

<p><i>Geotropic stimulus.</i>&mdash;The stimulus of gravity induces,
as I shall show in a subsequent chapter, a similar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
responsive torsion, the direction of which is determined
by the direction of the incident stimulus.</p>


<h4>EFFECT OF DIFFERENTIAL EXCITABILITY ON THE
DIRECTION OF TORSION.</h4>

<p>Under normal conditions, the torsional response under
light places the upper surface of the leaf or leaflets at
right angles to light. That this movement is not due
to some specific sensibility to light is shown by the
fact that all modes of stimulation, chemical, thermal or
gravitational, induce similar responsive torsion. The torsional
response is, moreover, shown to be determined by the
direction of incident stimulus, and the differential excitability
of the organ. This latter may be reversed by the
local application of various depressing agents on the normally
more excitable lower half of the pulvinus. Under
this treatment, the lower half of the pulvinus may be
rendered relatively the less excitable. Lateral application
of light now induces a torsional movement which is
the reverse of the normal, so that the upper surface of
the leaf moves away from light. The advantage of the
plant cannot, therefore, be the factor which determines
the directive movement; the teleological argument often
advanced is, in any case, no real explanation of the
phenomenon.</p>

<p>In all the instances given above, and under every
mode of stimulation, the responsive movement makes the
less excitable half of the pulvinus face the stimulus. The
torsional response is, in reality, the mechanical result of
the differential contraction of a complex organ, which is
fixed at one end and subjected to lateral stimulation.
I have been able to verify this, by the construction of
an artificial pulvinus consisting of a compound strip, the
upper half of which is ebonite, and lower half the more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>
contractile stretched India-rubber; if such a strip be held
securely at one end in a clamp, and if the lateral flank,
consisting half of ebonite and half of India-rubber, be
subjected to radiation, and record taken in the usual
manner, it will be found that a torsional response takes
place which is similar to that of the pulvinus of <i>Mimosa</i>.
The above experiment was devised to offer an explanation
of the mechanics of the movement. It should, however, be
borne in mind in this connection that the torsional
response of pulvinus is brought about by differential
<i>physiological</i> contraction of the organ, the movement being
abolished at death.</p>

<p>From the results given above, we arrive at the following:&mdash;</p>


<h4>LAWS OF TORSIONAL RESPONSE.</h4>

<p>1. AN ANISOTROPIC ORGAN, WHEN LATERALLY EXCITED
BY ANY STIMULUS, UNDERGOES TORSION BY WHICH THE
LESS EXCITABLE SIDE IS MADE TO FACE THE STIMULUS.</p>

<p>2. THE INTENSITY OF TORSIONAL RESPONSE INCREASES
WITH THE DIFFERENTIAL EXCITABILITY; WHEN THE
ORIGINAL DIFFERENCE IS REDUCED, OR REVERSED, THE
TORSIONAL RESPONSE UNDERGOES CONCOMITANT DIMINUTION
OR REVERSAL.</p>

<p>Having thus established the laws that guide torsional
response, I shall try to explain certain related phenomena
which are regarded as highly obscure. I shall also describe
the application of the method of torsional response
in various investigations.</p>


<h4>COMPLEX TORSION UNDER LIGHT.</h4>

<p>The leaves of the so-called "Compass plants" exhibit
very complex movements, these being modified according to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
the intensity of incident light. Thus in compass plants the
leaves, under moderate intensity of light in the morning
or in the evening, turn themselves so as to expose their
surfaces to the incident rays. But under intense sun light,
the leaves perform bendings and twistings so that they
stand at profile at midday.</p>

<p>I have not yet been able to secure "Compass plants"
at Calcutta. I shall, however, describe my investigations on
the complicated torsional movements exhibited by certain
leaflets by the action of vertical light. The results
obtained from these will show that torsional movements,
even the most complex, are capable of explanation from
the general laws that have been established.</p>

<p><i>Torsional movement of leaflet of</i> Cassia alata: <i>Experiment
152.</i>&mdash;These leaflets are closed laterally at night but
place themselves in an outspread position at day time.
The character of the movement is, however, modified by
the intensity of light. With moderate light in the morning
the leaflets open out laterally. But under more intense
light, the pulvinules of the leaflets exhibit a torsion by
which the formerly infolded surfaces of the leaflets are
exposed at right angles to light from above (Fig. 150).
Such complicated movements, in two directions of space, are
also exhibited by other leaflets which are closed at night
in a lateral direction.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 640px;">
<img src="images/fig-150.jpg" width="640" height="243" alt="Fig. 150." title="" />
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 150.</span>&mdash;Leaflets of <i>Cassia alata</i>: open in daytime, and closed in evening.</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span></p>

<p>For obtaining an explanation of these complex movements
under different intensities of light, we have first to
discover the particular disposition of the two halves of
the pulvinule which are unequally excitable; we have next
to explain the responsive movements under the directive
action of moderate and of intense light.</p>

<p><i>Determination of differential excitabilities of the organ:
Experiment 153.</i>&mdash;In the leaflet of <i>Cassia</i> the movement
of opening under diffuse stimulation of light can only be
brought about by the contraction of the outer half, which
must therefore be the more excitable. This is independently
demonstrated by the reaction to an electric-shock.
On subjecting the half closed leaflets to diffuse electric
stimulation, they open outwards in a <i>lateral</i> direction.
The disposition of the unequally excitable halves of the
pulvinule is thus different from that of the main pulvinus
of <i>Mimosa</i>. In the latter, the plane that divides the two
halves is horizontal, the lower half being the more excitable.
Thus in the pulvinule of <i>Cassia</i> the plane that separates
the two unequally excitable halves is vertical, the outer
half being the more excitable than the inner. By inner
half is here meant that half which is inside when the
leaflets are closed.</p>

<p><i>Effect of strong vertical light: Experiment 154.</i>&mdash;When
the plant is placed in a moderately lighted room,
the leaflets open out laterally to the outmost. This is
brought about by the contraction of the more excitable
outer half of the organ. If strong light be thrown down
from above, a new movement is superposed, namely, of
torsion by which the leaflets undergo a twist and thus place
their inner surface at right angles to the vertical light.
In order to investigate this phenomenon in greater detail I
placed the plant in a well lighted room, the leaflets
being three quarters open under the diffuse light. A very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
light index was attached to the leaflet for magnifying the
subsequent torsional movement. A strong beam of parallel
light from an arc lamp was thrown down on the pulvinule
from above; this fell at the junction of the more
excitable outer with the less excitable inner half of
the organ, the plane of separation of the two unequally
excitable halves being, as previously explained, vertical.
I have shown that under lateral stimulation, a differentially
excitable organ undergoes torsion by which the less excitable
half is made to face the stimulus. Since it is the
inner half of the organ that is the less excitable, the
attached leaflet becomes twisted so as to expose its (former
infolded) surface upwards, at right angles to the incident
light.</p>

<p>As a confirmatory test, strong light was made to strike
the pulvinule from <i>below</i> with the result that the leaflets
exhibited an opposite torsion by which their surfaces faced
downwards, so as to be at right angles to light that struck
them from below.</p>

<p>Under normal conditions sunlight comes from above;
stimulation thus takes place at the junction of the two
differentially excitable halves of the organ, the plane of
separation of which is vertical. The torsion induced makes
the less excitable inner half turn in such a way that the
inner surfaces of the leaflets are placed perpendicular to
the incident light.</p>


<h4>ADVANTAGES OF THE METHOD OF TORSIONAL RESPONSE.</h4>

<p>The torsional response not only affords a new method
of enquiry on the reaction of various stimuli, but it also
possesses certain advantages. For instance in studying the
response of the leaf of <i>Mimosa</i> under light, the records were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>
taken of the movement of the leaf in a vertical plane. But
the responsive up-movement, induced by light acting from
above, is opposed by the weight of the leaf. But in the
torsional response, the leaf rests on the hooked glass
support and the movement is thus free from the complicating
factor of the weight of the leaf. Again the pulvinus
of <i>Mimosa</i>, for example, is sometimes subject to spontaneous
variation of turgor, on account of which it exhibits an autonomous
up or down movement. In the ordinary method of
record the true response to external stimulus may thus be
modified by natural movement of the leaf. But in the
torsional method, the autonomous up or down movement is
restrained by the hooked support, and the response to lateral
stimulus is unaffected by the spontaneous movement of the
leaf. The torsional method, moreover, opens out possibilities
of inquiry in new directions, such as the comparison of
the excitatory effects of different stimuli by the Method of
Balance, and the determination of the effective direction
of geotropic stimulus.</p>


<h4>THE TORSIONAL BALANCE.</h4>

<p>A beam of light falling on the left flank of the pulvinus
of <i>Mimosa</i> induces a torsion against the hands of the
clock. A second beam falling on the right flank opposes
the first movement; the resultant effect is therefore
determined by the effective stimulation of the two flanks.
The pulvinus thus becomes a delicate index by which
two stimuli may be compared with each other. The following
experiment is cited as an example of the application of
the method of phototropic balance.</p>

<p><i>Experiment 155.</i>&mdash;Parallel beam of light from a small
arc lamp passing through blue glass falls on the left flank
of the pulvinus; a beam of blue light also strikes the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>
pulvinus from the right side, and the intensity of the latter
is so adjusted that the resultant torsion is zero. Blue glass
is now removed from the left side, the unobstructed white
light being allowed to fall on the left flank of the pulvinus.
This was found to upset the balance, the resultant
torsion being anti-clockwise. This showed that white light
induced greater excitation than blue light. We next interpose
a red glass on the left side, with the result that the
balance is upset in the opposite direction. This is because
the phototropic effect of red light is comparatively feeble.
We may thus compare the tropic effect of one form of
stimulus against a totally different form, phototropic against
geotropic action for example. It is enough here to draw
attention to the various investigations rendered possible by
the method of balance. Concrete examples of some of
these will be given in a subsequent chapter.</p>


<h4>DETERMINATION OF THE DIRECTION OF STIMULUS.</h4>

<p>I have shown that the torsion, clockwise or anti-clockwise,
is determined by the direction of incident stimulus.
Hence it would be possible to determine the direction of
incident stimulus from the observed torsional movement.
In the case of light, the direction of incident stimulus
is quite apparent. But it is difficult to determine the direction
of stimulus which is itself invisible. In such cases,
the torsional movement gives us infallible indication of
the effective direction of stimulus. The application of this
principle will be found in a later chapter.</p>


<h4>SUMMARY.</h4>

<p>Lateral stimulus induces a torsional response in a dorsiventral
organ. This is true of all modes of stimulation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span></p>

<p>The responsive torsion is determined by the direction
of incident stimulus, and the differential excitability of two
halves of the organ, the torsion being such that the less
excitable half of the organ is made to face the stimulus.</p>

<p>The twist exhibited by various leaves and leaflets under
light finds its explanation from the demonstrated laws of
torsional response.</p>

<p>The direction of incident stimulus may be determined
from the responsive torsion of a dorsiventral organ.</p>

<p>The Method of Torsional Balance enables us to compare
the excitatory efficiencies of two different stimuli which

<p>We have studied the tropic curvature induced by
different rays of light. We saw that while the more refrangible
rays of the spectrum were most effective, the less
refrangible rays were ineffective. Below the red, there are
the thermal rays about whose tropic effect very little is
definitely known.</p>

<p>The intricacies of the problem are very great owing to
the difficulty of discriminating the effect of temperature
from that of radiation; to this must be ascribed the contradictory
results that have been obtained by different observers,
of which Pfeffer gives the following summary:<a name="FNanchor_A_24" id="FNanchor_A_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>"In addition to the action of ultra-red rays which are
associated with the visible part of the spectrum, dark heat-rays
of still greater wave length, as well as differences of
temperature may produce a thermotropic curvature in
certain cases. Wortmann observed that seedlings of <i>Lepidium
sativum</i> and <i>Zea Mays</i>, as well as sporangiphores of
<i>Phycomyces</i> curved towards a hot iron plate emitting dark
heat-rays. Steyer has, however, shown that the sporangiphore
of <i>Phycomyces</i> has no power of thermotropic reaction....
Wortmann observed that the seedling shoot of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>
<i>Zea Mays</i> was positively, but that of <i>Lepidium</i> negatively,
thermotropic.... Steyer, however, found that both plants
were positively thermotropic. Wortmann has also investigated
the radicles of seedlings by growing them in boxes
of saw-dust, one side being kept hot, the other cold."</p>

<p>It will be noted that in the investigations described
above, thermotropic reaction has been assumed to be the
same under variation of temperature (as in experiments
with unequally heated saw-dust), and under radiation from
heated plate of metal. With reference to this Jost maintains
that "so far as we know, thermotropism due to
<i>radiant</i> heat cannot be distinguished from thermotropism
due to <i>conduction</i>."<a name="FNanchor_A_25" id="FNanchor_A_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>The effect of temperature, within optimum limits, is a
physiological expansion and enhancement of the rate of
growth. The effect of visible radiation is, on the other hand,
a contraction and retardation of growth. Should radiant
heat act like light, the various tropic effects in the two cases
would be similar; the temperature effect would in that case
be opposite to the radiation effect. In order to find whether
the thermal radiation produces tropic curvature similar to
that of light, we have to devise a crucial experiment in
which the complicating factor of rise of temperature on the
responding organ is eliminated.</p>

<p><i>Experiment 156.</i>&mdash;I have described the effect of light
applied unilaterally to the stem of <i>Mimosa</i>, at a point diametrically
opposite to the indicating leaf (<i>Expt.</i> 104). It was
shown that the effect of indirect stimulus induced at first
an erectile movement of the leaf, and that this was followed
by a fall of the leaf on account of transverse transmission
of excitation. In the present experiment I applied thermal
radiation instead of light. The source of radiation was a
spiral of platinum wire heated short of incandescence by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>
means of electric current. The intensity of incident radiation
could thus be maintained constant, or increased or
decreased by approach or recession of the radiating spiral.
The effect of unilateral stimulus of heat-rays was found
exactly similar to that of light; <i>i.e.</i>, there was at first
an erectile movement due to indirect stimulation, followed
by the fall of the leaf due to transmitted excitation. It
will be noticed that under the particular condition of the
experiment, the responding pulvinus was completely shielded
from temperature-variation. The reaction to thermal
radiation is thus similar to that of light.</p>

<p>As regards the effects of rise of temperature and radiation
I have shown that they are antagonistic to each other
(pp. 211, 308). Thus in positive types of thermonastic organs
like the flower of <i>Zephyranthes</i>, while rise of temperature
induces a movement of opening, radiation causes the opposite
movement of closure. Again, in the negative type
exemplified by <i>Nymph&aelig;a</i>, rise of temperature induces a
movement of closure; radiation on the other hand, brings
about the opposite movement of opening. The tropic effect
of thermal radiation thus takes place in opposition to that
of rise of temperature, and the resultant effect is therefore
liable to undergo some modification, depending on the
relative sensibility of the organ to radiation and to
variation of temperature.</p>

<p>The facts that have been given above prove that infra-red
radiation is as effective a mode of stimulation as the
more refrangible rays of the spectrum. Phototropic and
radio-thermotropic reactions would therefore prove to be
essentially similar. The following experiments fully confirm
the similarity of the two reactions.</p>


<h4>POSITIVE RADIO-THERMOTROPISM.</h4>

<p><i>Experiment 157.</i>&mdash;I shall now describe the normal reaction
of a growing organ to the unilateral stimulus of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span>
thermal radiation. Figure 151 gives a record of response
of the stem of <i>Dregea</i> to stimulus of short duration; the
induced curvature is positive or towards the source of
heat. On the cessation of stimulus, there is a recovery
which is practically complete, and which takes place at a
slower rate than the excitatory positive curvature. Repetition
of stimulus gives rise to responses similar to the
first. <i>Successive stimuli of moderate intensity thus give
rise to repeated responses of growth curvature.</i> An arbitrary
distinction has been made between the responses of
pulvinated and of growing organs. The former is distinguished
as a movement of variation, with its supposed
characteristic of repeated response. But the experiment
described shows that this is also met with in the response
by growth curvature. It is only under long continued
stimulation that the curvature is fixed by growth.</p>

<h4>DIA-RADIO-THERMOTROPISM.</h4>

<p>The positive curvature is induced by retardation of
growth at the proximal side, and enhancement of growth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>
at the distal side. This latter effect is, as we have seen,
brought about by the effect of indirect stimulation.</p>

<p>But under long continued action of stimulus, the negative
or excitatory impulse reaches the distal side, inducing
diminution of turgor and retardation of the rate of growth.
This leads to neutralisation, the organ placing itself at
right angles to the orienting stimulus.</p>

<p><i>Experiment 158.</i>&mdash;This neutralisation is seen in the
record given in figure 152, where under continuous unilateral
stimulation, the growing organ exhibited its maximum
positive curvature, after which the movement became<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span>
arrested by the arrival of the excitatory impulse at the
distal side, on account of which the first positive curvature
became neutralised. Further continuation of stimulus caused
a reversal into negative in the course of 7 minutes. It will
thus be seen that in inducing phototropic curvature, the
heat rays in sunlight play as important a part as the
more refrangible rays of the spectrum.</p>


<h4>SUMMARY.</h4>

<p>The effects of rise of temperature and of radiation are
antagonistic to each other.</p>

<p>Under unilateral action of thermal radiation a positive
curvature is induced by the retardation of growth at the
proximal, and acceleration of growth at the distal side of
the organ.</p>

<p>There is a complete recovery on the cessation of
stimulus of moderate intensity and short duration. Repeated
responses may thus be obtained similar to repeated
responses in pulvinated organs. In certain tissues the
power of conduction in a transverse direction is wanting;
excitation remains localised at the proximal side, and the
responsive curvature remains positive.</p>

<p>In other cases, there is a slow conduction of excitation
to the distal side. The result of this under different
circumstances is dia-radio-thermotropic neutralization, or a
reversed negative curvature.</p>

<p>In inducing phototropic curvature, the heat rays in
sunlight play as important a part as the more refrangible
rays of the spectrum.</p>

<p>A growing plant bends towards light, and this is true
not only of the main stem but also of its branches and
attached leaves and leaflets. Light affects growth, the effect
being modified by the intensity of radiation. Strong stimulus
of light causes a diminution of the rate of growth,
but very feeble stimulus induces an acceleration. The
tropic effect is very strong in the ultra-violet region of the
spectrum with its extremely short wave length, but the
effect declines practically to zero as we move towards the
less refrangible rays&mdash;the yellow and the red with their
comparatively long wave length. As we proceed beyond
the infra-red region, we come across the vast range of
electric radiation, the wave lengths of which vary from
0&middot;6 cm., the shortest wave I have been able to produce,
to others which may be miles in length. There thus arises
the very interesting question, whether plants perceive and
respond to the long ether waves including those employed
in signalling through space.</p>

<p>At first sight this would appear to be very unlikely;
for the most effective rays are in the ultra-violet region
with wave length as short as 20 &times; 10<sup>-6</sup> cm.; but with
electric waves used in wireless signalling we have to deal
with waves 50 million times as long. The perceptive power
of our retina is confined within the very narrow range of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>
a single octave, the wave lengths of which lie between
70 &times; 10<sup>-6</sup> cm. and 35 &times; 10<sup>-6</sup> cm. It is difficult to
imagine that plants could perceive radiations so widely
separated from each other as the visible light and the invisible
electric radiation.</p>

<p>But the subject assumes a different aspect, when we
take into consideration the <i>total</i> effect of radiation on the
plant. Light induces two different effects which may
broadly be distinguished as external and internal. The
former gives rise to movement; the latter finds no outward
manifestation, but consists of an 'up' or assimilatory chemical
change, with concomitant increase of potential energy.
Of the two reactions then, one is dynamic attended by dissimilatory
'down' change; the other is potential, associated
with the opposite 'up' change. In reality the two effects
take place simultaneously; but one of these becomes predominant
under definite conditions.</p>

<p>The modifying condition is the <i>quality</i> of light; with
reference to this I quote the following from Pfeffer: "So
far as is at present known, the action of different rays of
the spectrum gives similar curves in regard to heliotropic
and phototactic movements, to protoplasmic streaming and
movements of the chloroplastids as well as the photonastic
movements produced by growth or by changes of turgor.
On the other hand, it is the less refrangible rays which are
most active in photo-synthesis."<a name="FNanchor_A_26" id="FNanchor_A_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> The dynamic and potential
manifestations are thus seen to be complementary to
each other, the rays which induce photo-synthesis being relatively
ineffective for tropic reaction and <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>.</p>

<p>Returning to the action of electric waves, since they
exert no photo-synthetic action they might conceivably
induce the complementary tropic effect. These considerations
led me to the investigation of the subject fourteen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>
years ago, and my results showed that very short electric
waves induce a retardation of rate of growth; they also
produce responsive movements of the leaf of <i>Mimosa</i>, when
the plant was in a highly sensitive condition.<a name="FNanchor_A_27" id="FNanchor_A_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> The energy
of the short electric waves is very feeble, and undergoes
great diminution at a distance; hence the necessity of employment
of a specimen of plant in a highly sensitive condition.</p>

<p>I resumed my investigations on the subject at the beginning
of this year. I wished to find out whether plants in
general perceived and responded to the long ether waves
which reached it from a distance. The perception of the
wireless stimulation was to be tested not merely by the
responsive movement of sensitive plants, but by diverse
modes of response given by all kinds of plants.</p>

<p>Stimulus induces, as we have seen, three different types
of response in plants. It causes excitation in sensitive
plants like <i>Mimosa</i>, in consequence of which the leaf
undergoes a fall; this is the mechanical response to
stimulus. Stimulus also induces electric response in plants,
both sensitive and ordinary, the excited tissue undergoing
an electric change of galvanometric negativity. Finally, the
effect of stimulus on growing plants is a variation in the
rate of growth, an acceleration under feeble, and a retardation
under strong stimulus. I undertook to investigate the
effect of electric waves on plants by the methods of
mechanical and of electrical responses, and also by that of
induced variation of growth.</p>

<h4>THE WIRELESS SYSTEM.</h4>

<p>For sending wireless signals, I had to improvise the
following arrangement, more powerful means not being
available. The secondary terminals of a moderate sized
Ruhmkorff's coil were connected with two cylinders of
brass, each 20 cm. in length; the sparking took place
between two small spheres of steel attached to the cylinders.
One of the two cylinders was earthed, and the other
connected with the aerial 10 meters in height. The
receiving aerial was also 10 meters in height and its
lower terminal led to the laboratory, and connected by
means of a thin wire to the experimental plant growing
in a pot; this latter was put in electric connection<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>
with the earth (Fig. 153). The distance between the transmitting
and receiving aerial was about 200 meters, the
maximum length permitted by the grounds of the Institute.</p>


<h4>MECHANICAL RESPONSE OF <i>Mimosa</i>.</h4>

<p><i>Experiment 159.</i>&mdash;One of the leaves of <i>Mimosa</i> was
connected with the aerial by means of a thin tinsel of
loose wire, which did not interfere with the free movement
of the leaf. This latter was attached to the recording
lever. Wireless signals induced a responsive fall of the
leaf (Fig. 154) which was gradual as under action of
light, and not so abrupt as under a mechanical blow.</p>

<h4>THE ELECTRIC RESPONSE.</h4>

<p><i>Experiment 160.</i>&mdash;The leaf of <i>Mimosa</i> was in this
experiment held securely, and two electrical connections
made, one with the less excitable upper and the other
with the more excitable lower half of the pulvinus. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>
incident ether-wave induced an electric response in the
pulvinus, the more excitable lower half exhibiting galvanometric
negativity. On the cessation of stimulus there
was a recovery (Fig. 155).</p>

<p>It is not at all necessary to employ the sensitive
<i>Mimosa</i> for exhibition of electric response; for this is
universally exhibited by all plants. The only condition
for electric response is that the points of electric contacts
should be made with two unequally excitable areas in
the plant. This may be secured by artificial means as
by causing 'injury' to one point of contact.<a name="FNanchor_A_28" id="FNanchor_A_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> It is
however much better to take advantage of the natural
difference of excitability of two different areas in the
organ as in the pulvinus of <i>Mimosa</i>. This difference
of excitability is also found between the inner and outer
sides of a hollow tubular organ as in the peduncles of
various lilies. I was thus able to secure specimens
which were far more sensitive to the action of electric
waves than the pulvinus of <i>Mimosa</i>.</p>


<h4>EFFECT OF WIRELESS STIMULATION ON GROWTH.</h4>

<p>There now remains the very interesting question as to
whether the effect of long ether waves induce any variation
of growth. The results given below show that growing
plants not only perceive but respond to the stimulus of
electric waves. The effects to be presently described are
exhibited by all plants.</p>

<p>I shall, however, content myself in describing a typical
experiment carried with the seedling of wheat. The specimen
was mounted on the Balanced Crescograph, and the
growth exactly balanced. This gives a horizontal record;
an acceleration of growth above the normal is, in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>
following records, represented by a down curve, and a
retardation by an up-curve.</p>

<p><i>Effect of feeble stimulus: Experiment 161.</i>&mdash;I first studied
the effect of feeble stimulus. This was secured by decreasing
the energy of sparks of the radiator. The response
was an acceleration of rate of growth as seen in figure
156a. The analogy of this with the accelerating effect of
sub-minimal intensity of light (p. 224) is very remarkable.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 640px;">

stimulus by retardation, (<i>c</i>) responses to medium stimulation&mdash;retardation followed
by recovery. Down-curve represents acceleration, and up-curve retardation of growth:
(Seedling of wheat.)</p>
</div>

<p><i>Effect of strong stimulus: Experiment 162.</i>&mdash;The maximum
energy radiated by my transmitter, as stated before,
was only moderate. In spite of this its effect on plants was
exhibited in a very striking manner. The balance was
immediately upset, indicating a retardation of the rate of
growth. The latent period, <i>i.e.</i>, the interval between the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>
incident wave and the response, was only a few seconds
(Fig. 156b). The record given in the figure was obtained
with the moderate magnification of 2,000 times only. But
with my Magnetic Crescograph, the magnification can
easily be raised ten million times; and the response of
plant to the space signalling can be exalted in the same
proportion.</p>

<p>Under an intensity of stimulus slightly above the
sub-minimal, the responses exhibit retardation of growth
followed by quick recovery, as seen in the series of records
given in Fig. 156c.</p>

<p>A remarkable peculiarity in the response was noticed
during the course of the experiments. Strong stimulation
by ether waves gives rise, as we have seen, to a very
marked retardation of the rate of growth. Repeated
stimulation induces fatigue, and temporary insensitiveness
of the organ. Under moderate fatigue the effect is a
prolongation of the latent period. Thus in a particular
experiment the plant failed to give any response to a
short signal. But after an interval of five minutes a
marked response occurred to the wireless stimulus that
had been received previously. The plant had perceived the
stimulus but on account of fatigue the latent period was
prolonged, from the normal 5 seconds to as many minutes.</p>


<h4>SUMMARY.</h4>

<p>Plants not only perceive, but also respond to long ether
waves employed in signalling through space.</p>

<p>Mechanical response to wireless stimulation is exhibited
by the leaf of <i>Mimosa pudica</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span></p>

<p>All plants give electric response to the stimulus of long
ether waves.</p>

<p>Growing plants exhibit response to electric waves by
modification of rate of growth. Feeble stimulus induces
an acceleration, while strong stimulus causes a retardation
of the rate of growth.</p>

<p>The perceptive range of the plant is far greater
than ours; it not only perceives but responds to the
different rays of the vast ethereal spectrum.</p>

<h2><a name="XXXIX_GEOTROPISM" id="XXXIX_GEOTROPISM"></a>XXXIX.&mdash;GEOTROPISM</h2>

<h3><i>By</i><br />

<br /><span class="smcap">Sir J. C. Bose.</span></h3>


<p>No phenomenon of tropic movement appears so inexplicable
as that of geotropism. There are two diametrically
opposite effects induced by the same stimulus of gravity,
in the root a movement downwards, and in the shoot a
movement upwards. The seeming impossibility of explaining
effects so divergent by the fundamental reaction of
stimulus, has led to the assumption that the irritability of
stem and root are of opposite character. I shall, however,
be able to show that this assumption is unnecessary.</p>

<p>The difficulty of relating geotropic curvature to a definite
reaction to stimulus is accentuated by the fact that the
direction of the incident stimulus, and the side which
responds effectively to it are not clearly understood; nor
is it known, whether the reaction to this stimulus is a
contraction, or its very opposite, an expansion.</p>

<p>Taking the simple case of a horizontally laid shoot,
the geotropic up-curvature is evidently due to differential
effect of the stimulus on upper and lower sides of the
organ. The up-curvature may be explained by one or the
other of two suppositions: (1) that the stimulus of gravity
induces contraction of the upper side; or (2) that the
fundamental reaction is not a contraction but an expansion
and this of the lower side. The second of these two
assumptions has found a more general acceptance.</p>

<p>Tropic curvatures in general are brought about by the
differential effect of stimulus on two sides of the organ<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>.
Thus light falling on one side of a shoot induces local
contraction, the rays being cut off from acting on the
further side by the opacity of the intervening tissue. But
there is no opaque screen to cut off the vertical lines of
gravity,<a name="FNanchor_A_29" id="FNanchor_A_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> which enter the upper side of a horizontally laid
shoot and leave it by the lower side. Though lines of
force of gravity are transmitted without hindrance, yet a differential
action is found to take place, for the upper side,
where the lines of force enter, becomes concave, while the
lower side where they emerge becomes convex. Why
should there be this difference?</p>

<p>For the removal of various obscurities connected with
geotropism it is therefore necessary to elucidate the following:</p>

<p>1. The sign of excitation is, as we found, a contraction
and concomitant galvanometric negativity. Does gravitational
stimulus, like stimulus in general, induce this
excitatory reaction?</p>

<p>2. What is the effective direction of geotropic stimulus?
In the case of light, we are able to trace the
rays of light which is incident on the proximal side and
measure the angle of inclination. In the case of gravity,
the invisible lines of force enter by one side of the
organ and leave by the other side. Assuming that the
direction of stimulus is coincident with the vertical lines
of gravity, is it the upper or the lower side of the organ
that undergoes effective stimulation?</p>

<p>3. What is the law relating to the 'directive angle'
and the resulting geotropic curvature? By the directive
angle (sometimes referred to as the angle of inclination)
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>is meant, as previously explained, the angle which direction
of stimulus makes with the responding surface.</p>

<p>4. We have finally to investigate, whether the assumption
of opposite irritabilities of the root and the shoot is
at all justifiable. If not, we have to find the true explanation
of the opposite curvatures exhibited by the two types
of organs.</p>

<p>Of these the first three are inter-related. They will,
however, be investigated separately; and each by more than
one method of inquiry. The results will be found to be
in complete harmony with each other.</p>

<p>I propose in this and in the following chapters to
carry out the investigations sketched above, employing two
independent methods of enquiry, namely, of mechanical
and of electrical response. I shall first describe the automatic
method I have been able to devise, for an accurate
and magnified record of geotropic movement and its time
relations.</p>


<h4>THE GEOTROPIC RECORDER.</h4>

<p>The recorder shown in figure 157 is very convenient
for study of geotropic movement. The apparatus is four-sided
and it is thus possible to obtain four simultaneous
records with different specimens under identical conditions.
The recording levers are free from contact with the recording
surface. By an appropriate clock-work mechanism,
the levers are pressed for a fraction of a second against
the recording surfaces. The successive dots in the
record may, according to different requirements, be
at intervals varying from 5 to 20 seconds. The
records therefore not only give the characteristic curves of
geotropic movements of different plants, but also their time
durations. For high magnification, I employ an Oscillating<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>
Recorder, the short arm of the lever being 2&middot;5 mm.,
and the long arm 250 mm., the magnification being a
hundredfold; half that magnification is, however, sufficient
for general purposes.</p>

</div>


<h4>DETERMINATION OF THE CHARACTER OF GEOTROPIC
REACTION.</h4>

<p>The observed geotropic concavity of the upper side of a
horizontally laid shoot may be due to excitatory <i>contraction</i>
of that side, or it may result from passive yielding to the
active responsive <i>expansion</i> of the lower side. The crucial<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span>
test of excitatory reaction under geotropic stimulus is
furnished by investigations on geo-electric response. When
a shoot is displaced from vertical to horizontal position,
<i>the upper side of the organ is found to undergo an excitatory
electric change of galvanometric negativity</i> indicative
of diminution of turgor and <i>contraction</i>. The electric
change induced on the lower side is one of galvanometric
positivity, which indicates an increase of turgor and expansion.
The tropic effect of geotropic stimulus is thus
similar to that of any other mode of stimulation, <i>i.e.</i>, a
contraction of the upper (which in the present case is the
proximal) and expansion of the lower or the distal side.
The vertical lines of gravity impinge on the upper side of
the organ which undergoes effective stimulation.</p>

<p>In order to show that the concavity of the upper side
is not due to the passive yielding to the expansion of
the lower half, I restrained the organ from any movement.
I have explained that excitatory electric response is manifested
even in the absence of mechanical expression of
excitation; and under geotropic stimulus, the securely held
shoot gave the response of galvanometric negativity of
the upper side. Hence the fundamental reaction under
geotropic stimulus is excitatory <i>contraction</i> as under other
modes of stimulation.</p>

<p>Finally, I employed the additional test of induced paralysis
by application of intense cold. Excitatory physiological
reaction is, as we know, abolished temporarily by the
action of excessive cold.</p>

<p><i>Experiment 163.</i>&mdash;I obtained records of mechanical response
to determine the side which undergoes excitation
under geotropic stimulus, the method of discrimination being
local paralysis induced by cold. I took the flower-scapes
of <i>Amarayllis</i> and of <i>Uriclis</i>, and holding them vertical
applied fragments of ice on one of the two sides. I then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span>
laid the scape horizontal, first with cooled side below, the
record showed that this did not affect the geotropic movement.
But on cooling the upper side, the geotropic movement
became arrested, and it was not till the plant had
assumed the temperature of the surroundings that the
geotropic movement became renewed. Figure 158 shows
the effect of alternate application of cold, on the upper
and lower sides of the organ.<a name="FNanchor_A_30" id="FNanchor_A_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> In the shoot, therefore, it
is the upper side of the organ that becomes effectively
stimulated. Before proceeding further I shall make brief
reference to the highly suggestive statolithic theory of
gravi-perception.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 158.</span>&mdash;Effect of alternate application of cold on the upper and lower sides of
the organ. Application of cold on upper side (down-pointing arrow) induces arrest of
geotropic movement. Application below (up-pointing arrow) causes no arrest.</p>
</div>



<h4>THEORY OF STATOLITHS.</h4>

<p>With regard to the perception of geotropic stimulus
there can be no doubt that this must be due to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span>
effect of weight of cell contents, whether of the sap
itself, or of the heavy particles contained in the cells,
exerting pressure on the sensitive plasma. The theory
of statoliths advocated by Noll, Haberlandt and Nemec
(in spite of certain difficulties which further work may
remove) is the only rational explanation hitherto offered
for gravi-perception. The sensitive plasma is the ectoplasm
of the entire cell, and statoliths are relatively
heavy bodies, such as crystals and starch grains.
Haberlandt has found statoliths in the apo-geotropic
organs like stems.<a name="FNanchor_A_31" id="FNanchor_A_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> When the cell is laid horizontal,
it is the lower tangential wall which has to support
the greater weight, and thus undergo excitation. In
the case of multicellular plants laid horizontally, the
excitation on the upper side is, as we have seen, the
more effective than on the lower side. This inequality,
it has been suggested, is probably due to this difference
that the statoliths on the upper side press on the inner
tangential walls of the cells while those on the lower
side rest on the outer tangential walls.</p>

<p>When the organ is held erect, the action of statoliths
would be symmetrical on the two sides. But when it is
laid horizontal a complete rearrangement of the statoliths
will take place, and the differential effects on the upper
and lower sides will thus induce geotropic reaction. This
<i>period of migration</i> must necessarily be very short; but
the reaction time, or the latent period, is found to be of
considerable duration. "Even in rapidly reacting organs
there is always an interval of about one to one and a
half hours, before the horizontally placed organ shows a
noticeable curvature, and this latent period may in other
cases be extended to several hours."<a name="FNanchor_B_32" id="FNanchor_B_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> This great difference
between the <i>period of migration</i> and the <i>latent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span>
period</i> offers a serious difficulty in the acceptance of the
theory of statoliths. But it may be urged that the
latent period has hitherto been obtained by relatively
crude methods, and I therefore undertook a fresh
determination of its value by a sensitive and accurate
means of record.</p>


<h4>DETERMINATION OF THE LATENT PERIOD.</h4>

<p>As regards the interpretation of the record of geotropic
movement, it should be borne in mind that after the
perception of stimulus a certain time must elapse before
the induced growth-variation will result in curvature.
There is again another factor which causes delay in the
exhibition of true geotropic movement; for the up-movement
of stems, in response to the stimulus of gravity, has
to overcome the opposite down movement, caused by
weight, before it becomes at all perceptible. On account
of the bending due to weight there is a greater tension
on the upper side, which as we have seen (p. 193),
enhances the rate of growth, and thus tends to make
that side convex. The exhibition of geotropic response
by induced contraction of the excited upper side thus
becomes greatly delayed. In these circumstances I tried
to discover specimens in which the geotropic action would
be quick, and in which the retarding effect of weight
could be considerably reduced.</p>

<p><i>Geotropic response of flower stalk of Tuberose: Experiment
164.</i>&mdash;For this I took a short length of flower
stalk of tuberose in a state of active growth; the flower
head itself was cut off in order to remove unnecessary
weight. After a suitable period of rest for recovery from
the shock of operation, the specimen was placed in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>
horizontal position, and its record taken. The successive
dots in the curve are at intervals of 20 seconds, and
the geotropic up-movement is seen to be initiated
(Fig. 159) after the tenth dot, the latent period being
thus 3 minutes and 20 seconds, the greater part of which
was spent in overcoming the down-movement caused by
the weight of the organ.</p>

</div>


<p><i>Geotropic response of petiole of</i> Trop&aelig;olum: <i>Experiment
165.</i>&mdash;I expected to obtain still shorter latent
period by choosing thinner specimens with less weight. I
therefore took a cut specimen of the petiole of <i>Trop&aelig;olum</i>,
and held it at one end. The lamina was also cut
off in order to reduce the considerable leverage exerted
by it. The response did not now exhibit any preliminary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span>
down-movement, and the geotropic up-movement was commenced
within a few seconds after placing the petiole in
a horizontal position (Fig. 160). The successive dots in
the record are at intervals of 20 seconds and the second
dot already exhibited an up-movement; the latent period
is therefore shorter than 20 seconds. It will thus be seen
that the latent period in this case is of the same order as
the hypothetical period of migration of the statoliths.</p>

<p>I may state here that I have been successful in
devising an electric method for the determination of the
latent period, in which the disturbing effect of the weight
of the organ is completely eliminated. Applying this
perfect method, I found that the latent period was in
some cases as short as a second. The experiment will
be found fully described in a later chapter.</p>


<h4>THE COMPLETE GEOTROPIC CURVE.</h4>

<p>The characteristics of the geotropic curve are similar
to those of other tropic curves. That is to say the
susceptibility for excitation is at first feeble; it then
increases at a rapid rate; in the third stage the rate
becomes uniform; and finally the curvature attains a
maximum value and the organ attains a state of geotropic
equilibrium (cf. page 353). The period of completion
of the curve varies in different specimens from a
few to many hours.</p>

<p><i>Experiment 166.</i>&mdash;The following record was obtained
with a bud of <i>Crinum</i>, the successive dots being at
intervals of 10 minutes. After overcoming the effect of
weight (which took an hour), the curve rose at first
slowly, then rapidly. The period of uniformity of movement
is seen to be attained after three hours and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span>
continued for nearly 90 minutes. The final equilibrium
was reached after a period of 8 hours (Fig. 161).</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 161.</span>&mdash;The Complete Geotropic curve (<i>Crinum</i>).</p>
</div>


<p>For studying the effect of an external agent on geotropic
action, the period of uniform movement is the most
suitable. Acceleration of the normal rate (with enhanced
steepness of curve) indicates that the external agent acts
with geotropism in a concordant manner; depression of
the rate with resulting flattening of the curve shows, on
the other hand, the antagonistic effect of the outside
agent.</p>


<h4>DETERMINATION OF EFFECTIVE DIRECTION OF STIMULUS.</h4>

<p>The experiments which have been described show that
it is the upper side (on which the vertical lines of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span>
gravity impinge) that undergoes excitation. The vertical
lines of gravity must therefore be the direction of incident
stimulus. This conclusion is supported by results of three
independent lines of inquiry: (1) the algebraical summation
of effect with that of a different stimulus whose
direction is known, (2) the relation between the directive
angle and geotropic reaction, and (3) the torsional response
under geotropic stimulus.</p>

</div>


<h4>EFFECT OF ALGEBRAICAL SUMMATION.</h4>


<p><i>Experiment 167.</i>&mdash;A flower bud of <i>Crinum</i> is laid
horizontally, and record taken of its geotropic movement.
On application of light on the upper side at L,
the responsive movement is enhanced, proving that
gravity and light are inducing similar effects. On the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span>
cessation of light, the original rate of geotropic movement
is restored (Fig. 163). Application of light of increasing
intensity from below induces, on the other hand, a diminution,
neutralisation, or reversal of geotropic movement.</p>

<p>Light acting vertically from above induces a concavity
of the excited upper side in consequence of which the
organ moves, as it were, to meet the stimulus. The geotropic
response is precisely similar. In figure 162 the
arrow represents the direction of stimulus which may be
rays of light or vertical lines of gravity.</p>


<h4>ANALOGY BETWEEN THE EFFECTS OF STIMULUS OF
LIGHT AND OF GRAVITY.</h4>

<p>In geotropic curvature we may for all practical purposes
regard the direction of stimulus as coinciding with the
vertical lines of gravity. The analogy between the effects of
light and of gravity is very close<a name="FNanchor_A_33" id="FNanchor_A_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>; in both the induced
curvature is such that the organ moves so as to meet the
stimulus. This will be made still more evident in the
investigations on torsional geotropic response described in a
subsequent chapter. The tropic curve under geotropic
stimulus is similar to that under photic stimulus. The
tropic reaction, both under the stimulus of light and of
gravity, increases similarly with the 'directive' angle.
These real analogies are unfortunately obscured by the use
of arbitrary terminology used in description of the geotropic
curvature of the shoot. In figure 163 records are
given of the effects of vertical light and of vertical
stimulus of gravity, on the responses of the horizontally
laid bud of <i>Crinum</i>. In both, the upper side undergoes
contraction and the movement of response carries the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span>
organ upwards so as to place it parallel to the incident
stimulus. Though the reactions are similar in the two
cases, yet the effect of light is termed <i>positive</i> phototropism,
that of gravity <i>negative</i> geotropism. I would draw
the attention of plant-physiologists to the anomalous
character of the existing nomenclature. Geotropism of the
shoot should, for reasons given above, be termed <i>positive</i>
instead of <i>negative</i>, and it is unfortunate that long usage
has given currency to terms which are misleading, and
which certainly has the effect of obscuring analogous
phenomena. Until the existing terminology is revised, it
would perhaps be advisable to distinguish the geotropism
of the shoot as <i>Zenithotropism</i> and of the root as <i>Nadirotropism</i>.</p>


<h4>RELATION BETWEEN THE DIRECTIVE ANGLE AND
GEOTROPIC REACTION.</h4>

<p>When the main axis of the shoot is held vertical, the
angle made by the surface of the organ with lines of
force of gravity is zero, and there is no geotropic effect.
The geotropic reaction increases with the directive angle;
theoretically the geotropic effect should vary as the sine
of the angle. I shall in the next chapter describe the
very accurate electrical method, which I have been able to
devise for determination of relative intensities of geotropic
action at various angles. Under perfect conditions of
symmetry, the intensity of effect is found to vary as the
sine of the directive angle. This quantitative relation fully
demonstrates that geotropic stimulus acts in a definite
direction which coincides with the vertical lines of
gravity.</p>

<p>The conditions of perfect symmetry for study of geotropic
action at various angles will be fully described in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span>
the next chapter. In the ordinary method of experimentation
with mechanical response the organ is rotated in a
vertical plane. The geotropic movement is found increased
as the directive angle is increased from zero to 90&deg;.</p>


<h4>DIFFERENTIAL GEOTROPIC EXCITABILITY.</h4>

<p>It has been shown that geotropic stimulus acts more
effectively on the upper side of the organ. The intensity of
geotropic reaction is, moreover, modified by the excitability
of the responding tissue. It is easy to demonstrate this
by application of depressing agents on the more effective
side of the organ. The rate of geotropic up-movement will
be found reduced, or even abolished by the local application
of cold, an&aelig;sthetics like chloroform, and of poisonous
potassium cyanide solution.</p>

<p>The different sides of a dorsiventral organ are
unequally excitable to different forms of stimuli. I
have already shown (p. 85) that the lower side of the
pulvinus of <i>Mimosa</i>, is about 80 times more excitable to
electric stimulus than the upper side. Since the effect of
geotropic stimulus is similar to that of other forms of
stimuli, the lower side of the pulvinus should prove to be
geotropically more excitable than the upper side. This
I have been able to demonstrate by different methods of
investigation which will be described in the following
chapters.</p>

<p>Under ordinary circumstances, the upper half of the
pulvinus is, on account of its favourable position, more
effectively stimulated by geotropic stimulus; in consequence
of this the leaf assume a more or less horizontal position
of "dia-geotropic" equilibrium. But when the plant is
inverted the more excitable lower half of the organ now
occupies the favourable position for geotropic excitation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span>
The leaf now erects itself till it becomes almost parallel
to the stem. The response of the same pulvinus which
was formerly "dia-geotropic" now becomes "negatively geotropic";
but an identical organ cannot be supposed to
possess two different specific sensibilities. The normal
horizontal position assumed by the leaf is, therefore, due
to differential geotropic excitabilities of the two sides of a
dorsiventral organ.</p>

<p>I have explained (p. 401) that when the pulvinus of
<i>Mimosa</i> is subjected to lateral stimulation of any kind, it
undergoes a torsion, in virtue of which the less excitable
half of the organ is made to face the stimulus. Experiments
will be described in a subsequent chapter which
show that geotropic stimulus also induces similar torsional
response. The results obtained from this method of enquiry
give independent proof: (1) that the lower half of the
pulvinus is geotropically the more excitable, and (2) that
the direction of incident geotropic stimulus is the vertical
line of gravity which impinges on the upper surface
of the organ.</p>


<h4>SUMMARY.</h4>

<p>The stimulus of gravity is shown to induce an excitatory
reaction which is similar to that induced by other
forms of stimulation. The direct effect of geotropic stimulus
is an incipient contraction and retardation of rate of
growth.</p>

<p>The upper side of a horizontally laid shoot is more
effectively stimulated than the lower side, the excited
upper side becoming concave. Electrical investigation also
shows that it is the upper side that undergoes direct
stimulation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span></p>

<p>Tropic reactions are said to be positive, when the
directly stimulated side undergoes contraction with the
result that the organ moves to meet the stimulus. According
to this test, the geotropic response of the stem is
<i>positive</i>.</p>

<p>The geotropic response is delayed by the bending down
of the horizontally laid shoot. Reduction of weight is found
to shorten the latent period; in the case of the petiole of
<i>Trop&aelig;olum</i> this is shorter than 20 seconds. The latent
period of geotropic response is found to be of the same
order as the "migration period" of the hypothetical statoliths.</p>

<p>The complete geotropic curve shows characteristics which
are similar to tropic curves in general.</p>

<p>In a dorsiventral organ the geotropic excitabilities of
the upper and lower sides are different. In the pulvinus
of <i>Mimosa</i> the geotropic excitability of the lower half is
greater than that of the upper half. The differential excitabilities
of a dorsiventral organ modifies its position of
geotropic equilibrium.</p>

<p>The experiments that have been described in the preceding
chapter show that the upper side of a horizontally
laid shoot undergoes excitatory contraction, in consequence
of which the organ bends upwards. The fundamental
geotropic reaction is, therefore, not expansion, but contraction
which results from all modes of stimulation.</p>

<p>In confirmation of the above, I wished to discover and
employ new means of detecting excitatory reaction under
geotropic stimulus. In regard to this, I would refer to the
fact which I have fully established that the state of excitation
can be detected by the induced electromotive change
of galvanometric negativity. This electrical indication of
excitation may be observed even in plants physically restrained
from exhibiting response by mechanical movement.<a name="FNanchor_A_34" id="FNanchor_A_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>


<h4>ELECTRIC RESPONSE TO STIMULUS.</h4>

<p>Before giving account of the results of investigations
on the detection of geotropic excitation by means of
electric response, I shall describe a few typical experiments
which will fully explain the method of the electrical
investigation, and show the correspondence of mechanical
and electric responses. I have explained how tropic curvatures
are brought about by the joint effects, of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span>
contraction of the directly excited proximal side A, and the
expansion of the distal side B. In the diagram of mechanical
response to stimulus (Fig. 164a) the excitatory contraction
is indicated by - sign, and the expansion, by + sign.
The resulting movement is, therefore, towards the stimulus
as shown by the curved arrow.</p>

<p>I shall now describe the corresponding electric effects
in response to unilateral stimulus. We have to determine
the induced electrical variation at the proximal side A,
and at the distal side B.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 800px;">

to direct unilateral stimulation indicated by arrow:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="nblockquot">(<i>a</i>) Positive mechanical response (curved arrow) due to contraction of directly
stimulated A, and expansion of indirectly stimulated B.</p>

<p class="nblockquot">(<i>b</i>) Electric response of induced galvanometric negativity of A under direct

<p class="nblockquot">(<i>c</i>) Electric response of induced galvanometric positivity at the distal point

<p class="nblockquot">(<i>d</i>) Additive effects of direct and indirect stimulations; galvanometric negativity
of the directly stimulated proximal A, and galvanometric positivity
of the indirectly stimulated distal point B.</p>
</div>
</div>



<p><i>Electric response to direct stimulation: Experiment 168.</i>&mdash;For
the determination of electric response at the directly excited
proximal side A, we take a shoot with a lateral leaf. The
point A, which is to undergo stimulation, is connected with
one terminal of the galvanometer, the other terminal being
led to an indifferent or neutral point N on the leaf.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span>
Application of any form stimulus at A, gives rise to an
electric current which flows through the galvanometer from
the neutral to the excited point A (Fig. 164b). <i>The directly
stimulated point A thus becomes galvanometrically negative.</i>
The "action" current lasts during the application of stimulus
and disappears on its cessation.</p>

<p><i>Electric response to indirect stimulation: Experiment
169.</i>&mdash;We have also seen that application of stimulus at A
causes indirect stimulation of the distal point B resulting
in an increase of turgor and expansion. The corresponding
electric change of the indirectly stimulated point
B is found in the responsive current, which flows now
through the galvanometer from the indirectly stimulated B
to the neutral point N (Fig. 164c). <i>The indirectly stimulated
point thus becomes galvanometrically positive.</i></p>

<p>Having thus obtained the separate effects at A and B,
we next modify the experiment for obtaining the joint
effects. For this purpose the neutral point N is discarded
and A and B connected directly with the indicating galvanometer.
On stimulation of A that point becomes negative
and B positive, and the current of response flows through
the galvanometer from B to A. The deflection is increased
by the joint electrical reactions at A and B (Fig. 164d).</p>

<p>The results may thus be summarised:&mdash;</p>

<p class="tabcap">TABLE XXXIII.&mdash;ELECTRIC RESPONSE TO DIRECT UNILATERAL STIMULUS.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span></p>

<p>Galvanometric negativity is thus seen to indicate the
effect of direct stimulus, and galvanometric positivity that
of indirect stimulus. We thus see the possibility of electric
detection of the effects of geotropic stimulation. This
method would, moreover, enable us to discriminate the side
of the organ which undergoes greater excitation.</p>


<h4>EXPERIMENTAL ARRANGEMENTS FOR OBTAINING GEO-ELECTRIC
RESPONSE.</h4>

<p>Returning to the investigation on electric response to
geotropic stimulus, the specimen of plant is at first held
erect; two electrodes connected with a sensitive galvanometer
are applied, one to an indifferent point, and the
other to one side of the shoot. The sensitiveness of the
galvanometer was such that a current of one millionth of
an ampere produced a deflection of the reflected spot of
light through 1,000 divisions of the scale. An action
current is produced on displacement of the plant from
vertical to horizontal position.</p>

<p><i>Non-polarisable electrodes.</i>&mdash;The electrical connections
with the plant are usually made by means of non-polarisable
electrodes (amalgamated zinc rod in zinc-sulphate solution
and kaolin paste with normal saline). I at first
used this method and obtained all the results which will
be presently described. But the employment of the usual
non-polarisable electrodes with liquid electrolyte is, for our
present purpose, extremely inconvenient in practice; for the
plant-holder with the electrodes has to be rotated from
vertical to horizontal through 90&deg;. The reliability of
the non-polarisable electrode, moreover, is not above
criticism. The zinc-sulphate solution percolates through
the kaolin paste and ultimately comes in contact with
the plant, and seriously affects its excitability. The
name non-polarisable electrode is in reality a misnom&#275;r<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span>;
for the action current (whose polarising effect is to
be guarded against) is excessively feeble, being of the
order of a millionth of an ampere or even less; the
counter polarisation induced by such a feeble current is
practically negligible.</p>

<p>The idea that non-polarisable electrodes are meant to
get rid of polarisation is not thus justified by the facts
of the case. The real reason for its use is very
different; the electrical connections with the plant has
to be made ultimately by means of two metal contacts.
If we take two pieces of metal even from the same
sheet, and put them in connection with the plant, a
voltaic couple is produced owing to slight physical
differences between the two electrodes. Amalgamation of
the two zinc rods with mercury reduces the electric
difference but cannot altogether eliminate it.</p>

<p>I have been able to wipe off the difference of potential
between two pieces of the same metal, say of platinum,
and by immersing them in dilute salt solution
from a voltaic couple. The circuit is kept complete
for 24 hours, and the potential of the two electrodes
by this process is nearly equalised. A perfect equality
is secured by repeated warming and cooling of the
solution and by sending through the circuit, alternating
current which is gradually reduced to zero. I have
by this means been able to obtain two electrodes which
are iso-electric. The specially prepared electrodes (made
of gold or platinum wire) are put in connection with
the plant through kaolin paste moistened with normal
saline solution. Care should be taken to use opaque cover
over the plant-holder, so as to guard against any possible
photo-electric action; moistened blotting paper maintains
the closed chamber in a uniform humid condition.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span></p>

<p>The direct method of contact described above is
extremely convenient in practice; the resistance of contact
is considerably reduced, and there is no possibility of its
variation during the necessary process of rotation of the
plant for subjecting it to geotropic action.</p>

</div>



<h4>GEO-ELECTRIC RESPONSE OF THE UPPER AND LOWER
SIDES OF THE ORGAN.</h4>

<p>We have next to discover the electric change induced
by geotropic stimulus on the upper and lower sides of
the organ. For this purpose it is necessary to find a
neutral point which is not affected by the inclination of
the organ from vertical to horizontal position. For the
present experiment, I employed the flower of the water
lily <i>Nymph&aelig;a</i>, the peduncle of which is sensitive to geotropic
action. One electrical contact is made with a
sepal, which is always kept vertical; the other electric
contact is made at the point A, on one side of the
flower stalk (Fig. 165). On making connections with a
sensitive galvanometer a very feeble current was found,
which was due to slight physiological difference between<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span>
the neutral point, N, and A. This natural current may be
allowed to remain, the action current due to geotropism
being <i>superposed on it</i>; or the natural current may be
neutralised by means of a potentiometer and the reflected
spot of light brought to zero of the scale.</p>

<p><i>Induced electric variation on upper side of the organ:
Experiment 170.</i>&mdash;While the sepal is held vertical, the
stalk is displaced through +90&deg; so that the point A is
above. Geotropic stimulation is at once followed by a
responsive current which flows through the galvanometer
from N to A, the upper side of the organ thus exhibiting
excitatory reaction of galvanometric negativity (Right-hand
figure of 166). When the stalk is brought back to vertical
position geotropic stimulation disappears, and with it the
responsive current.</p>

<p><i>Electric response of the lower side: Experiment 171.</i>&mdash;The
stalk is now displaced through -90&deg;; the point A, which
under rotation through +90&deg; pointed upwards, is now
made to point downwards. The direction of the current
of response is now found to have undergone a reversal;
it now flows from A on the lower side to the neutral
point N; thus under geotropic action <i>the lower side of
the organ exhibits galvanometric positivity</i> indicative of
increase of turgor and expansion (Left-hand figure 166).<a name="FNanchor_A_35" id="FNanchor_A_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>Having thus found that the upper side of the organ
under geotropic stimulus becomes galvanometrically negative,
and the lower side, galvanometrically positive, we
make electric connections with two diametrically opposite
points of the shoot A and B, and subject the organ
to alternate rotation through +90&deg; and -90&deg;. The electro-motive
changes induced at the two sides now became
algebraically summated. I employ two methods for geotropic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span>
stimulation:  that (1) of Axial  Rotation, and (2) of
Vertical Rotation.</p>

</div>


<h4>METHOD OF AXIAL ROTATION.</h4>

<p>In the method of Axial Rotation, the organ is held
with its long axis horizontal (Fig. 166 H). We have seen
that the geotropic action increases with the angle which
the responding surface of the organ makes with the
vertical lines of gravity. When the organ is held with
its length horizontal, the angle made by its two sides, A
and B, with the vertical is zero and there is thus no
geotropic effect. There is, moreover, no differential effect,
since the two sides are symmetrically placed as regards
the vertical lines of force. The plant is next rotated
round its long axis, the angle of rotation being indicated
in the circular scale. When the rotation is through +90&deg;,
A is above and B below; this induces a differential
geotropic effect, the upper side exhibiting excitatory electric
change of galvanometric negativity.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Experiment 172.</i>&mdash;I shall, as a typical example, give a
detailed account of experiments with the petiole of
<i>Trop&aelig;olum</i> which was found so highly excitable to
geotropic stimulus (p. 434). The specimen was held horizontal
with two symmetrical contacts at the two sides, the electrodes
being connected in the usual manner with the indicating
galvanometer. When the plant is rotated through +90&deg;
there is an immediate current of response, the upper
side becoming <i>galvanometrically negative</i>. This excitatory
reaction on the upper side finds, as we have seen, mechanical
expression by contraction and concavity, with positive
or up-curvature.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 800px;">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 167.</span>&mdash;Diagrammatic representation of the geo-electric response of the
shoot (see text).</p>
</div>


<p>The differential stimulation of A and B disappears on
rotation of the axis back to zero position, and the induced
electro-motive response also disappears at the same time.
If now the axis be rotated through -90&deg;, A will become
the lower, and B the upper and the excited side. The
electro-motive change is now found to have undergone a
reversal, B becoming galvanometrically negative. This
induced electro-motive variation under geotropic stimulus is
of considerable intensity often exceeding 15 millivolts. The
characteristic electric change is shown diagrammatically in
figure 167 in which the middle figure shows the symme<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span>trical
or zero position. On rotation through +90&deg; (figure
to the right) A occupies the upper and B the lower
position. A is seen to exhibit induced change of galvanometric
negativity. Rotation through -90&deg; reverses the
current of response, as B now occupies the upper and A
the lower position.</p>


<h4>CHARACTERISTICS OF GEO-ELECTRIC RESPONSE.</h4>

<p>There are certain phenomena connected with the electric
response under geotropic stimulus which appear to be
highly significant. According to statolithic theory</p>

<p>"Geotropic response begins as soon as an organ is deflected
from its stable position, so that a few starch-grains
press upon the ectoplasts occupying the walls which are
underneath in the new position; an actual rearrangement
of the starch-grains is therefore not an essential condition
of stimulation. As a matter of fact, the starch-grains do
very soon migrate on to the physically lower walls, when
a positively or negatively geotropic organ is placed horizontally,
with the result that the intensity of stimulation
gradually increases attaining its maximum value when all
the falling starch-grains have moved on to the lower region
of the ectoplast. The time required for the complete
rearrangement of the statoliths may be termed the period
of migration; its average length varies from five to twenty
minutes in different organs."<a name="FNanchor_A_36" id="FNanchor_A_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>Stimulation, according to the statolithic theory, is induced
by the displacement of the particles. The diameter of the
geotropically sensitive cells is considerably less than
0&middot;1 mm.; and the stimulus will be perceived after the very
short interval taken by the statoliths to fall through a space
shorter than 0&middot;1 mm. This may be somewhat delayed by
the viscous nature of the plasma, but in any case the period<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span>
for perceptible displacement of the statoliths should be very
short, about a second or so, and the latent period of
perception of stimulus should be of this order.</p>

<p>The mechanical indication of response to stimulus
is delayed by a period which is somewhat indefinite; for
the initiation of responsive growth variation will necessarily
lag behind the perception of stimulus.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 640px;">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 168.</span>&mdash;Geo-electric response of the petiole of <i>Trop&aelig;olum</i>.</p>
</div>




<p><i>Experiment 173.</i>&mdash;The mechanical response with its drawbacks
is thus incapable of giving an accurate value of the
latent period. The electrical method of investigation labours
under no such disadvantage, since the excitation is here
detected even in the absence of movement. The perception
of stimulus will thus be followed by response without
undue delay. I shall in this connection give a record of
electric response of the quickly reacting petiole of <i>Trop&aelig;olum</i>,
when the angle of inclination is increased from zero
to 90&deg;. The responsive movement of the galvanometer
spot of light was initiated in less than 5 seconds and
the maximum deflection was reached in the course of 90
seconds. The angle was next reduced to zero, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span>
deflection practically disappeared in the further course of
a minute and a half (Fig. 168). There was a small
"excitation remainder". But with vigorous specimens the
recovery is complete.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 640px;">
<img src="images/fig-169.jpg" width="596" height="480" alt="Fig. 169." title="" /><br />
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 169.</span>&mdash;Geo-electric response of the scape of <i>Uriclis</i>.</p>
</div>


<p>The latent period of quickly reacting petiole of <i>Trop&aelig;olum</i>
is thus about 5 seconds, a value which is more
consonant with the idea of particles inducing excitation by
their fall through an exceedingly short distance. In very
sluggish organs latent period may be as long as a
minute (Fig. 169), which is considerably shorter than an
hour, the generally accepted value. Further even in the
electric response, the latent period will be delayed beyond
the period of perception. For this perception takes place
in some unknown sensitive layer in the interior of the
tissue, while electric contact is made with the epidermis
outside. It is obvious that certain time must elapse before
the excitation, initiated at the sensitive layer, should reach
the epidermis. Under ideal conditions of experiment which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span>
will be described in a subsequent chapter, the latent period
for geotropic excitation, I find, to be sometimes as short as
a second.</p>


<h4>PHYSIOLOGICAL CHARACTER OF GEO-ELECTRIC RESPONSE.</h4>

<p>The intensity of the electro-motive variation is found
to depend on the physiological vigour of the specimen.
The <i>Trop&aelig;olum</i> plant, used for most of the above experiments,
are at the best condition of growth in Calcutta
in February; after this the plants begin to decline in
March and die off by the end of April.</p>

<p><i>Experiment 174.</i>&mdash;In February the intensity of electric
response was nearly double of that in March; it was only
in March that I made quantitative determination of the
induced electro-motive force between the upper and lower
contacts on rotation of the specimen from zero to 90&deg;.
The E. M. F. was determined by the potentiometer method.
I give below the following typical values obtained with
two different specimens:&mdash;</p>


<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><th>Specimen &nbsp;  &nbsp;</th><th colspan='2'>Induced E. M. F.</th></tr>
<tr><td align='center'>(1)</td><td align='center'>12</td><td align='center'>millivolts.</td></tr>
<tr><td align='center'>(2)</td><td align='center'>15</td><td align='center'>"</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>In the most favourable season the induced electro-motive
force is likely to exceed the above value very
considerably.</p>

<p><i>Effect of Age.</i>&mdash;While a young petiole gave the above
value, an old specimen from the same plant exhibited
no response. The plants were in a dying condition in
April and all indications of electrical reaction were found
abolished. The physiological character of the response was
also demonstrated by first obtaining the normal electric
response in a vigorous specimen; after death, by immersion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span>
in boiling water, the plant gave no electric response to
geotropic stimulus.</p>


<h4>EFFECT OF DIFFERENTIAL EXCITABILITY OF THE ORGAN.</h4>

<p>I have hitherto described the geo-electric effect of
radial and isotropic organs. The induced E. M. F. at 90&deg;
was found practically the same whether A was above and
B below, and <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>. In the mechanical response of the
pulvinus of <i>Mimosa</i>, the geotropic excitability was, however,
found to be greater in the lower half than in the upper
(p. 440). I wished to investigate the question of differential
geotropic excitability anew, by means of electric response.</p>

<p><i>Experiment 175.</i>&mdash;Electric connections with the galvanometer
were made with the upper and lower halves of the
pulvinus, the organ being placed in the vertical or neutral
position. The angle of inclination was then increased to
90&deg; in the positive and negative directions alternately.</p>

<p class="tabcap">TABLE XXXIV.&mdash;DIFFERENCE OF GEO-ELECTRIC RESPONSE OF UPPER AND
LOWER HALVES OF THE PULVINUS OF <i>Mimosa</i>.</p>

<div class='center'>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="2" summary="" rules="cols">
<tr><td class='bbox'>Specimen.</td><td class='bbox'>Position of particular half of pulvinus.</td><td class='bbox'> Induced E. M. F.</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>(1)</td><td align='left'>Upper half above<br />Lower half above</td><td align='left'> 23 millivolts.<br />30 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  "</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>(2)</td><td align='left'>Upper half above<br />Lower half above</td><td align='left'> 16 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "<br /> 29 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>In the former case the upper half of the pulvinus occupied
the up-position; in the second case the up-position was
occupied by the lower half of the pulvinus. In both cases
strong electric responses were obtained, the upper point
of contact being always galvanometrically negative. There
was, however, a difference between the two responses, the
excitatory electro-motive variation was invariably greater<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span>
when the lower half of the organ occupied the favourable
up-position. This will be seen from the results of
two typical experiments in table given above.</p>

<p>The electrical mode of investigation thus leads to confirm
the result obtained with mechanical method that the
lower half of the pulvinus of <i>Mimosa</i> is geotropically
more excitable than the upper half.</p>


<h4>RELATION BETWEEN ANGLE OF INCLINATION AND
GEOTROPIC EFFECT.</h4>

<p>In the Method of Axial Rotation, the condition of the
experiment is ideally perfect; in the neutral position the
sides A and B are both parallel to the vertical lines of
gravity, and are little affected by geotropic reaction. As
the specimen is rotated on its long axis the vertical component
of the force of gravity increases with the angle of
inclination. The hypothetical statolithic particles will become
displaced all along the cell, and the vertical pressure
exerted by them will also increase with the angle.</p>

<p>The geo-electric response will then afford us a measure
of the intensity of excitation induced at various angles of
inclination. The mechanical response on account of its
inherent defects does not afford us the true relation between
the angle of inclination and intensity of geotropic
reaction. But the electric method of inquiry is free from
the defects of the mechanical method.</p>

<p><i>Experiment 176.</i>&mdash;The specimen was rotated so that the
angle of rotation was 45&deg;, and the maximum electric
response observed. The angle was next increased to 90&deg;
and the reading for the enhanced response taken. The
ratio of the geo-electric response at 90&deg; and 45&deg;, thus
affords us a measure of the effective stimulations at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span>
two angles. I give below a table which gives results
obtained with 24 different specimens.</p>

the same as <sup>Sin 90&deg;</sup>&frasl;<sub>Sin 45&deg;</sub> = 1&middot;4. Hence we arrive at the following
law:</p>

<p class="center"><i>The intensity on geotropic action varies as the sine of the

<h4>METHOD OF VERTICAL ROTATION.</h4>

<p>I have hitherto described results obtained with the
Method of Axial Rotation; I shall now take up the
second method, that of Vertical Rotation, diagrammatic
representation of which is given in figure 166V. The specimen
is held vertical and two electrical contacts, A and
B, made with the two lateral sides; it is then rotated
round a horizontal axis perpendicular to the length of the
specimen. Rotation may be carried in a right-handed
direction with increasing angle with the vertical. The
point A is thus subjected to enhanced geotropic stimulation
and exhibits increasing electric change of galvanometric
negativity; continuous decrease of angle of inclination
to zero by rotation in the reverse direction causes a
disappearance of the induced electric change. The rotation
is next continued in the negative direction by which
the point B is increasingly subjected to geotropic action.
B is now found to exhibit excitatory reaction, the current
of response having undergone a reversal. Rotation to the
right and left will be distinguished by plus and minus
signs.</p>


<h4>ELECTRIC RESPONSE THROUGH AN ENTIRE CYCLE.</h4>

<p><i>Experiment 177.</i>&mdash;When the specimen is vigorous, characteristic
response with its changing sign may be obtained
through an entire cycle from 0&deg; to +45&deg; to +90&deg;; then

the responses becomes enfeebled under fatigue. I give<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span>
below the results of a typical experiment carried out with
a vigorous specimen, the response being distinguished as - when

bringing about a reversal direction of the responsive current.</p>

<h4>RELATION BETWEEN ANGLE OF VERTICAL ROTATION AND
INTENSITY OF GEOTROPIC REACTION.</h4>

<p>The relation between the angle of inclination and the
resulting geotropic action has already been determined
by the Method of Axial Rotation. The ratio between
the geotropic effects at 90&deg; and 45&deg; was thus found
to be 1&middot;49, which is nearly the same as <sup>Sin 90&deg;</sup>&frasl;<sub>Sin 45&deg;</sub>. I was
next desirous of determining the relative excitations at the
two angles by the Method of Vertical Rotation. It is
necessary here to refer to certain differences of condition in
the two methods. In the Axial Method, the hypothetical
statoliths are distributed uniformly through the length of
the cell, and rotation round the long axis causes displacement
of the statoliths, the resulting pressure thus increasing
with the sine of the angle of inclination. But in the case
of vertical rotation through 45&deg; to the right, the statoliths
originally at the base of the cell accumulate to the right
hand corner of the cell; a portion of the basal side of
the cell is thus subjected to pressure. When the angle is
increased to 90&deg; the statoliths pass along the whole length
including the basal and apical sides of the cell; but the
excitability of the apical half may prove to be greater
than that of the basal half. Hence excitatory geotropic
effect is not likely to vary strictly as in sine of angle of
inclination.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span></p>

<p>Whatever the reason may be, I find as a result of
experiments with 12 different specimens that the mean
ratio of the effects at 90&deg; and 45&deg;, obtained by the Method
of Vertical Rotation, is 1&middot;8:1 which is greater than 1&middot;49:1
obtained by the Method of Axial Rotation, this latter
value being practically the same as <sup>Sin 90&deg;</sup>&frasl;<sub>Sin 45&deg;</sub>.</p>


<h4>SUMMARY.</h4>

<p>It is shown that the state of excitation under direct
stimulus is exhibited by an electrical change of galvanometric
negativity; the effect of indirect stimulus induces,
on the other hand, an electrical change of galvanometric
positivity. The negative electric change corresponds to
contraction and diminution of turgor; the positive electric
change indicates, on the other hand, an expansion and
increase of turgor.</p>

<p>The electric response to geotropic stimulus is studied
by the two methods of Axial and Vertical Rotation. The
upper side of a horizontally laid shoot is found to undergo
an excitatory change of galvanometric negativity.</p>

<p>In quick reacting organs the latent period of geo-electric
response is about 5 seconds, and the maximum excitation
is induced in the course of 2 minutes.</p>

<p>The geo-electric response is due to physiological reaction.
The intensity of response declines with age and is abolished
at the death of the plant.</p>

<p>Under symmetrical conditions, the intensity of geotropic
reaction is found proportional to the sine of the angle of
inclination.</p>

<p>Electric investigation shows that the lower half of the

<h2><a name="XLI_THE_MECHANICAL_AND_ELECTRICAL_RESPONSE" id="XLI_THE_MECHANICAL_AND_ELECTRICAL_RESPONSE"></a>XLI.&mdash;THE MECHANICAL AND ELECTRICAL RESPONSE<br />
OF ROOT TO VARIOUS STIMULI</h2>

<h3><i>By</i><br />

<br /><span class="smcap">Sir J. C. Bose.</span></h3>


<p>In the last chapter we studied the electric response of
the shoot to the stimulus of gravity, and found that the
excitatory effect of that stimulus is similar to that of other
forms of stimulation. Before taking up the subject of the
geo-electric response of the root to gravitational stimulus,
I shall describe the effects of other forms of stimuli on the
mechanical and electrical response of the root.</p>

<p>In connection with this subject, it should be borne in
mind that the responsive curvature in the root takes place
in the sub-apical growing zone which is separated by a
certain distance from the tip. The stimulus is therefore
direct when applied at the responding growing region; it is
indirect when applied at the tip of the root. The intervening
distance between the root-tip and the responsive zone of
growth is semi-conducting or non-conducting.</p>

<p>I shall proceed to give an account of my investigations
on the response of the root to direct and indirect unilateral
stimulation. We shall study:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(1) The Mechanical response to Direct unilateral stimulus.</p>

<p>(2) The Electrical response to Direct unilateral stimulus.</p>

<p>(3) The Mechanical response to Indirect unilateral
stimulus.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span></p>
<p>(4) The Electrical response to Indirect unilateral stimulus.</p></div>


<h4>MECHANICAL RESPONSE TO DIRECT STIMULUS.</h4>

<p>As the geotropic responses of the shoot and the root are
opposed to each other, the object of the investigation is to
find out; whether the response of the root to various stimuli
is specifically different from that of the shoot. We have
seen that tissues in general respond to direct unilateral
stimulus by contraction of the proximal and expansion of
the distal side, the tropic curvature being thus <i>positive</i>. We
shall now determine whether direct unilateral stimulation
of the root induces a tropic movement which is similar or
dissimilar to that exhibited by the shoot.</p>

<p><i>Experiment 178.</i>&mdash;In experimenting with roots of various
plants I obtained results which are precisely similar
to that of the shoot. The movement of the root was observed
by means of a reading microscope focussed on the
tip of the organ. I employed various forms of stimuli, mechanical,
thermal, and chemical. Unilateral application of
these on one side of the growing region gave rise to a <i>positive</i>
tropic curvature, resulting in a movement towards the
stimulus. These experiments confirm Sachs' observation
that unilateral application of stimulus in the region of
growth induces positive curvature of the root.</p>


<h4>ELECTRICAL RESPONSE TO DIRECT STIMULATION.</h4>

<p>I next undertook an investigation on the electric response
of the root to direct unilateral stimulation.</p>

<p><i>Experiment 179.</i>&mdash;The terminals of the galvanometer
were suitably connected with the two diametrically opposite
points A and B in the growing region of the root. Stimulus
was now applied very near the point A, the various stimuli
employed in different experiments being: (1) mechanical,
(2) chemical, and (3) thermal. In every instance the excited<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</a></span>
point A becomes galvanometrically negative. This shows
that the response of the root is in no way different from
that of the shoot.</p>


<h4>MECHANICAL RESPONSE TO INDIRECT STIMULUS.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 170.</span>&mdash;Mechanical and electrical
response to indirect stimulation at dotted
arrow. In figure to the left, the point
A, on the same side undergoes expansion,
with responsive mechanical movement
away from stimulus indicated by continuous
arrow. In figure to the right,
indirect stimulus at dotted arrow induces
electric response of galvanometric positivity
at A, indicative of increase of turgor
and expansion.</p>
</div>

<p>Before describing the effect of indirect stimulus on the
root, I shall recapitulate its
effects on ordinary tissues.
I have shown that the
effect of indirect unilateral
stimulus is to induce a
movement away from stimulus.
This was shown to be
the case with the bud of
<i>Crinum</i> (p. 275) and the
tendril of <i>Passiflora</i> (p. 291).
The mechanical and electric
response to indirect stimulation
in the shoot is shown
in the diagrammatic representation
(Fig. 170). I
shall now proceed to describe
the mechanical response
induced by unilateral
stimulation of the root tip.
As the responding region
of growth is at some distance
from the tip, the stimulation is therefore indirect.</p>

<p><i>Experiment 180.</i>&mdash;I employed at first mechanical stimulus
of moderate intensity by rubbing one side of the tip of
the root of <i>Bindweed</i>; this induced a movement away from
stimulus. Unilateral application of dilute acid gave rise
to a similar response. Thermal stimulus of moderate intensity
also induced responsive movement away from the stimulus
(Fig. 171).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span></p>

<p>Darwin in his <i>Movements of Plants</i> described experiments
on the responsive behaviour of the tip of the radicle.
He produced unilateral stimulation in three different ways,
first by attaching minute fragments of cardboard to one
side of the root-tip; this moderate and constant irritation
was found to induce a convexity on the same side of the
growing region, with the resulting negative movement, <i>i.e.</i>,
away from stimulus. His second method was chemical, one
side of the tip being touched with silver nitrate; the third
method of stimulation was a slanting cut. All these methods
induced a movement away from stimulus.</p>


<h4>ELECTRICAL RESPONSE TO INDIRECT STIMULATION.</h4>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 480px;">

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 171.</span>&mdash;Diagrammatic representation
of mechanical and electric
response of root to indirect stimulus
applied at the tip <i>a</i>. Figure to
the left shows responsive movement
away from stimulus. The
electric response to indirect stimulus
is indicated in the figure to the
right; the point on the same side
exhibiting galvanometric positivity.
The shaded part indicates the
responsive region of growth at
some distance from the tip.</p>
</div>


<p>The next investigation was for the determination of the
electrical change induced in the growing region by application
of unilateral stimulus at the root-tip.</p>

<p><i>Experiment 181.</i>&mdash;One of the two electrical connections
with the galvanometer is made
at one side of the growing region
A, the other connection being
made with the diametrically
opposite point B. Unilateral
stimulus was applied at the root
tip <i>a</i>, of the bean plant and on
the same side as A. I subjected
the tip to various modes of unilateral
stimulation. Mechanical
stimulation was effected by emery-paper
friction or by pin-prick;
chemical stimulation was produced
by application of dilute
hydrochloric acid. Thermal stimulation
was caused by the
proximity of electrically heated
platinum wire. In every case the response was by
<i>induced galvanometric positivity at A</i> (Fig. 171). This<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</a></span>
electrical variation took place within about ten seconds
of the application of stimulus; the interval would obviously
depend on the length of path to be traversed
by the transmitted effect of indirect stimulation.</p>

<p>The galvanometric positivity at A indicated that there
was induced at that point an increase of turgor and expansion,
in consequence of which the organ would move
away from stimulus. Thus both by the mechanical and
electrical methods of investigation we arrive at an identical
conclusion that the effects of unilateral stimulus at the
tip of the root gives rise to a movement, by which the
organ is moved away from the source of stimulus; since
tropic movement towards stimulus is termed <i>positive</i>, this
opposite response must be regarded as <i>negative</i>.</p>

<p>The root-tip when burrowing its way underground comes
in contact with hard substances and moves away from the
source of irritation. The irritability of the root-tip is
generally regarded as being specially evolved for the advantage
of the plant. But reference to experiments that,
have been described shows that this reaction is not unique
but exhibited by all plant organs, growing and non-growing.
Indirect stimulus has been shown to give rise, in
both shoot and root, to a <i>negative</i> tropic curvature in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</a></span>
contrast to the <i>positive</i> curvature brought about by direct
stimulation; the response of the root is therefore in no
way different from that of vegetable tissues in general.</p>

<p>It will also be seen that an identical stimulus induces
two opposite effects, according as the stimulus is applied
at the tip or at the growing region itself. In the former
case, the stimulus is indirect, and in the latter case it is
direct. The results are in strict conformity with the laws
of effects of direct and indirect stimulations that have
been established regarding plant response in general (p. 231).</p>


<h4>SUMMARY.</h4>

<p>In the root, the responsive region is in the zone of
growth. The tip of the root is separated from the region
of response by a semi-conducting or non-conducting tissue.</p>

<p>Direct unilateral stimulus (applied at the region of
growth) induces a positive curvature by the contraction of
the proximal and expansion of the distal side.</p>

<p>The electrical response to direct unilateral stimulus is
galvanometric negativity of the proximal, and galvanometric
positivity of the distal side.</p>

<p>Indirect unilateral stimulus induces expansion of the
proximal side resulting in negative curvature and movement
away from stimulus.</p>

<p>The corresponding electric response induced is galvanometric
positivity of the proximal side.</p>

<p>The responses of the root, to both direct and indirect
stimulations, are precisely similar to those in the shoot. The
assumption of specific irritability of the root as differing
from that of the shoot, is without any justification.</p>

<br /><span class="smcap">Sir J. C. Bose</span>,<br />

<br /><i>Assisted by</i><br />

<br /><span class="smcap">Satyendra Chandra Guha</span>.</h3>


<p>The effects of various stimuli, direct and indirect, on
the response of the root have been described in the last
chapter. These responsive reactions have been found to
be in no way different from those of the shoot. But the
shoot and the root exhibit under the stimulus of gravity,
responsive movements which are diametrically opposite to
each other. These opposite effects of an identical stimulus
have been regarded as due to specific differences of irritability
in the two organs, specially evolved for the advantage
of the plant. The root is thus supposed to be characterised
by "positive" and the shoot by "negative" geotropism.</p>

<p>As regards response to other forms of stimuli, the root
has been shown to behave like the shoot. We have now
to inquire whether the reaction of the root to gravitational
stimulus is specifically different to that of the shoot.</p>

<p>The electric method of investigation described in the
last chapter, holds out the possibility of discovering the
character of the responsive reaction induced in the root
by its displacement from vertical to horizontal position;
we shall, moreover, be able to make an electrical exploration
of the root-tip and the zone of growth, and thus
determine the qualitative changes of response, induced
in two regions of the root under the action of gravitational
stimulus. For the detection of geotropic action in the shoot,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</a></span>
electric contacts were made at two points diametrically
opposite to each other. Displacement of the shoot from
vertical to horizontal position induced excitatory change
of galvanometric negativity at the upper side of the organ,
demonstrating the effect of direct stimulation of that side;
this excitatory reaction of the upper side finds independent
mechanical expression in the induced contraction and
concavity of that side of the organ.</p>

<p>I employ a similar electric method for detection of
geotropic excitation of the root, responses to geotropic
stimulus being taken at the root-tip and also at the zone
of growth in which geotropic curvature is effected. I
shall now proceed to give a detailed description of the
characteristic electric responses of the tip and of the growing
region.</p>

<p>The two diametrically opposite contacts at the tip
will be distinguished as <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, the corresponding points
higher up in the growing region being A and B. When the
root is vertical the electric conditions of the two diametrically
opposite points are practically the same. But
when the root is rotated in a vertical plane through +90&deg;
a geo-electric response will be found to take place; the
direction of the responsive current disappears when the
root is brought back to the vertical. Rotation through
-90&deg; gives rise again to a responsive current, but its
direction is found reversed.</p>


<h4>GEO-ELECTRIC RESPONSE OF THE ROOT-TIP.</h4>

<p><i>Experiment 182.</i>&mdash;I took the root of the bean plant and
made two electric contacts with the diametrically opposite
points, <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, of the root-tip at a distance of about 1&middot;5
mm. from the extreme end. Owing to the very small<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</a></span>
size of the tip this is by no means an easy operation.
Two platinum points tipped with kaolin paste are very
carefully adjusted so as to make good electric contacts at
the two opposite sides, without exerting undue pressure.
For geotropic stimulation the root has to be laid horizontal,
and as the root of the bean plant is somewhat long and
limp, displacement from the vertical position is apt to
cause a break of the electric contact. This is avoided by
supporting the root from the top and also from the
sides; for the latter purpose, I use paddings of cotton wool.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 172.</span>&mdash;Diagrammatic representation of geo-electric response of root-tip.
The middle figure shows root in vertical position. Rotation through +90&deg; places
<i>a</i> above, which becomes galvanometrically negative. Rotation through -90&deg;,
places <i>b</i> above and makes it negative.</p>
</div>


<p>After due observance of these precautions the electric
response obtained is found to be very definite; when the
root is made horizontal, by rotation of the root through
+90&deg;, the point <i>a</i> is above, and the responsive current is
found to flow from <i>b</i> to <i>a</i>, <i>the upper side of the tip</i>
becoming galvanometrically negative; when the root is
brought back to the vertical, the responsive current disappears;
rotation through -90&deg; makes the point <i>b</i> occupy
the upper position, and the responsive current is from <i>a</i> to
<i>b</i>; the upper side thus exhibits in every case, an excitatory
electric change of galvanometric negativity (Fig. 172).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</a></span>
The root-tip thus exhibits the characteristic response to direct
stimulation. Experiments carried out with 12 different
specimens gave concordant results. The following table
gives the absolute values of electro-motive force induced
at the tip under geotropic stimulus.</p>

<h4>ELECTRIC RESPONSE IN THE GROWING REGION.</h4>

<p><i>Experiment 183.</i>&mdash;I next undertook an investigation on
the electric variation induced in the growing region under
the stimulus of gravity. The experimental difficulties are
here greatly reduced, since the available area of contact
for galvanometric connection is not so restricted as in the
case of the root-tip. The specimen is securely mounted so
that the root is vertical. It is next rotated in the vertical
plane through +90&deg;, so that the point A in the growing
region occupied the upper position. The electric response
in the growing region took place in a short time and was
very distinct. The induced electric change at A was now
galvanometric <i>positivity</i> indicative of increase of <i>turgor
and expansion</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</a></span></p>

<p>The series of experiments were carried out in the
following order. The specimen was first rotated through
+90&deg; so that A was above. The responsive electric variation
rendered it galvanometrically positive. The root was
rotated back to neutral position when the current disappeared.
The root was next rotated through -90&deg; and
the responsive current became reversed, the upper B becoming
electro-positive (Fig. 173). The alternative rotations
through +90&deg; and -90&deg; were carried out six times in
succession with consistent results. The interval allowed
between one stimulation and the next was determined by
the period of complete recovery. Growing fatigue was
found to increase this period; at first it was seven minutes,
at the second repetition it was ten minutes, and at the
third time it was prolonged to fifteen minutes.</p>

<h4>ADDITIVE ACTION-CURRENT AT THE TIP AND THE
GROWING REGION.</h4>

<p>It has been shown that under geotropic stimulus the
upper side of the tip, <i>a</i>, becomes galvanometrically negative,
while the point A, higher up in the growing region,
becomes galvanometrically positive. If now we make the
two galvanometric connections with <i>a</i> and A, the induced
electric difference is increased, and the galvanometric response
becomes enhanced.</p>

<p><i>Experiment 184.</i>&mdash;The root was at first held vertical,
and two electric contacts made with <i>a</i> and A. In this
neutral position there is little or no current. But as soon
as the root was laid horizontal, an electro-motive response
was obtained which showed that <i>a</i> was galvanometrically
negative, and A galvanometrically positive (Fig. 173d).
The induced electric response disappeared on restoration of
the root to the vertical position. I give below the results
of typical experiments with a vigorous specimen which
gave strong electric response. It was possible to repeat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</a></span>
the geotropic stimulation six times in succession, the
results being perfectly consistent. The responses taken
in succession exhibited slight fatigue, the first deflection
being 140 divisions, and the sixth 115 divisions of the
galvanometer scale.</p>

<p>The results of experiments 182 and 183 are summarised
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(1) the induced galvanometric negativity at root tip
indicates direct stimulation of the tip, and</p>

<p>(2) the induced galvanometric positivity of the growing
region shows that it is the effect of indirect
stimulus that reaches it.</p></div>

<p>From these facts it will be seen that the tip perceives
the stimulus and thus undergoes excitation, and that
owing to the intervening tissue being a semi-conductor
of excitation, it is the positive impulse that reaches the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</a></span>
growing region and induces there an expansion and a
convex curvature.</p>


<h4>GEO-PERCEPTION AT THE ROOT TIP.</h4>

<p>The results given above fully confirm Charles Darwin's
discovery that it is the root tip that perceives the stimulus
of gravity<a name="FNanchor_A_37" id="FNanchor_A_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>; he found that removal of the tip
abolished the geotropic response of the root. Objection
has been raised about the shock-effect of operation itself
being the cause of abolition of response. But subsequent
observations have shown that Darwin's conclusions are in
the main correct.</p>

<p>The experiments which I have described on the geo-electric
response of the root tip and of the growing
region offer convincing proof of the perception of the
stimulus at the tip, and the transmission of the effect of
indirect stimulus to the growing region. These experiments
exhibit in an identical <i>uninjured</i> organ: the excitatory
reaction at the upper side of the tip, the cessation
of excitation, and the excitation of the opposite side of
the tip, following the rotation of the organ through
+90&deg;, 0&deg; and -90&deg;. The effect at the growing zone is
precisely the opposite to that at the tip, <i>i.e.</i>, an expansive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</a></span>
reaction which results from the effect of indirect stimulus,
in contrast to the contractile reaction due to direct
stimulation.</p>

<p>We may now proceed a step further and try to obtain
some idea of the difference in the mechanics of geotropic
stimulation of the shoot and of the root, to account for
the different responses in the two organs. The reason
of this difference lies in the fact that in the shoot the
perceptive and responding region is one and the same;
every cut-piece of stem exhibits the characteristic geotropic
curvature. In the root the case is different; for
the removal of the sensitive root-tip reduces or abolishes
the geotropic action; the region of maximum geotropic
perception is thus separated from that of response. It
must be borne in mind <i>that this holds good only in the
case of gravitational stimulus</i>, for the decapitated root
still continues to respond to other forms of stimulation
such as chemical or photic.</p>

<p>The cause of this difference in the reactions to
geotropic and other stimuli lies in the fact that in the
latter case, energy is supplied from outside. But in
geotropism the force of gravity is by itself inoperative;
it is only through the weight of the cell contents that
the stimulus becomes effective. Want of recognition of this
fundamental difference has led many observers in their
far-fetched and sweeping attempt, to establish an identity
of reaction of the root to geotropic and photic stimulations,
in spite of facts which plainly contradict it. Thus
the root moves away from the incident vertical line
of gravity; but under light, the root very often moves
towards the stimulus. The negative phototropic response
of the root of <i>Sinapis</i> is an exceptional phenomenon for
which full explanation has been given in page 376.</p>

<p>We shall next consider whether the particular distribution
of the falling starch-grains (which offers a rational<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</a></span>
explanation of geotropic stimulation) in the shoot and in
the root, is capable of furnishing an explanation of the
different geotropic responses in the two organs. In this
connection, the results of investigation of Haberlandt and
Nemec are highly suggestive. Haberlandt finds statoliths
present in the responding region of the stem; the
geotropic stimulation of the stem is therefore direct.
Nemec's investigation on the distribution of statoliths in
the root show, on the other hand, that it is the central
portion of the root cap that contains the falling starch
grains, and this would account for the indirect geotropic
stimulation of the root.</p>

<p>The theory of statoliths is, however, not essential for
the explanation of the opposite geotropic effects in the
shoot and in the root. The observed fact, that the perceptive
region in the root is separated from the responding
region, is sufficient to explain the difference of geotropic
action in the two organs. Through whatever means the
stimulus of gravity may act, it is inevitable, from the
fact that the stimulation of the shoot is direct and of the
root indirect, that an identical stimulus should in two
cases induce responsive reactions of opposite signs.</p>

<p>It will thus be seen that the postulation of two different
irritabilities in the shoot and in the root is wholly
unnecessary and unwarranted by facts. For the irritability
of the root has been shown to be in no way
different from that of other organs; an uniformity is thus
found to exist in the reaction of all vegetable tissues.</p>


<h4>SUMMARY.</h4>

<p>On subjection of the tip of the root to the stimulus
of gravity, the upper side exhibits excitatory reaction of
galvanometric negativity. This shows that the root-tip
undergoes direct stimulation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</a></span></p>

<p>The electric response in the growing region above the
stimulated point of the root-tip is positive, indicative of
increase of turgor and expansion. This is due to the effect
of indirect stimulus.</p>

<p>The stimulus of gravity is perceived at the root-tip;
it is the effect of indirect stimulus that is transmitted to
the responding region of growth.</p>

<p>In contrast with the above is the fact that the growing
region of the shoot is both sensitive and responsive to
geotropic stimulus.</p>

<p>As the effects of direct and indirect stimulation on
growth are antithetic, the responses of shoot and root to
the direct and indirect stimulus must be of opposite
signs.</p>

<p>There is no necessity for postulating two different irritabilities
for the shoot and the root, since tissues in general
exhibit positive or negative curvatures according as the
stimulus is direct or indirect.</p>

BY MEANS OF THE ELECTRIC PROBE</h2>

<p>The obscurities which surround the phenomenon of
geotropism arise: (1) from the invisibility of the stimulating
agent, (2) from want of definite knowledge as to whether
the fundamental reaction is contractile or expansive, and
(3) from the peculiar characteristic that the stimulus is only
effective when the <i>external</i> force of gravity reacts <i>internally</i>
through the mass of contents of the sensitive cells.</p>

<p>The experiments that have been detailed in the foregoing
chapters will have removed most of the difficulties. But
beyond these is the question of that power possessed
by plants of <i>perceiving</i> geotropic stimulus by means of
certain localised sense organs, which send out impulses in
response to which neighbouring cells carry out the movement
of orientation in a definite direction. Are the sensitive
cells diffusely distributed in the organ or do they form
a definite layer? Could we by the well established method
of physiological response localise the sensitive cells in the
interior of the organ? As the internal cells are not accessible,
the problem would appear to be beyond the reach of
experimental investigation.</p>

<p>It is true that post-mortem examination of sectioned
tissues under the microscope enables us to form a probable
hypothesis as regards the contents of certain cells causing
geotropic irritation; we have thus the very illuminating<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[Pg 479]</a></span>
theory of statoliths propounded by Noll, Haberlandt and
Nemec. But for the clear understanding of the <i>physiological
reaction</i> which induces the orientating movement, it is necessary
to get hold, as it were, of a single or a group of
sensory cells <i>in situ</i> and in a condition of fullest vital
activity; to detect and follow by some subtle means the
change induced in the perceptive organ and the irradiation
of excitation to neighbouring cells, through the entire
cycles of reaction, from the onset of geotropic stimulus
to its cessation.</p>

<p>The idea of obtaining access to the unknown geo-perceptive
cell in the interior of the organ for carrying out
various physiological tests would appear to be very extravagant;
yet I could not altogether give up the thought that
the obscure problem of geotropic action might be attacked
with some chance of success, by means of an electric probe
which would explore the excitatory electric distribution in
the interior of the organ. But the experimental difficulties
which stood in the way were so great that for a long time
I gave up any serious attempt to pursue the subject. And
it is only when the present volume is going through the
press that the very first experiments undertaken proved so
highly successful that I am able to give a short account of
the more important results, which cast a flood of light on
the obscurities of geotropic phenomena. The new method
has opened out, moreover, a very extensive range of
investigation on the activities of cells in the interior of
an organ, and enabled me to localise the conducting
'nerve' which transmits excitation in plants. These and
other results will be given in the next volume.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 174.</span>&mdash;Diagrammatic representation of the geo-perceptive layer in
unexcited vertical, and in excited horizontal position. (See text.).</p>
</div>



<h4>METHOD OF EXPLORATION BY THE ELECTRIC PROBE.</h4>

<p>The principle of the new method will be better understood
if I first explained the steps of reasoning by which I
was led to discover it. The experiments described in
Chapter XL showed that the upper surface of a horizontally
laid shoot exhibits sign of excitation by induced
galvanometric negativity; that this was due to the stimulus
of gravity was made clear by restoration of the plant-organ
to the vertical position, when all signs of electric excitation
disappeared. Now the skin of the organ on which the
electrode was applied could not be the perceptive organ, for
the removal of the epidermis did not abolish the geotropic
action; the perceptive layer must therefore lie somewhere
in the interior. As every side of a radial organ undergoes
geotropic excitation, the geo-perceptive cells must therefore
be disposed in a cylindrical layer, at some unknown depth
from the surface. In a longitudinal section of the shoot,
they would appear as two straight lines G and G&acute; (Fig. 174).
In a vertical position the geo-perceptive layer will remain
quiescent but rotation through +90&deg; would initiate the
excitatory reaction. Let us first centre our attention to the
geo-perceptive layer G, which occupies the upper position.
This sensitive layer perceives the stimulus and is therefore<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</a></span>
the focus of irritation; the state of excitation is, as we have
seen, detected by induced galvanometric negativity, and the
electric change would be most intense at the perceptive
layer itself. As the power of transverse conduction is feeble,
the excitation of the perceptive layer will irradiate into the
neighbouring cells in radial directions with intensity diminishing
with distance. Hence the intensity of responsive
electric change will decline in both directions outwards and
inwards.</p>

<p>The distribution of the excitatory change, initiated at
the perceptive layer and irradiated in radial directions is
represented by the depth of shading, the darkest shadow
being on the perceptive layer. Had excitation been attended
with change of light into shade, we would have witnessed
the spectacle of a deep shadow (vanishing towards the
edges) spreading over the different layers of cells during
displacement of the organ from vertical to horizontal; the
shadow would have disappeared on the restoration of the
organ to the vertical position.</p>

<p>Different shades of excitation in different layers is, however,
capable of discrimination by means of an insulated
electric probe, which is gradually pushed into the organ
from outside. It will at first encounter increasing excitatory
change during its approach to the perceptive layer where
the irritation will be at its maximum. The indicating
galvanometer in connection with the probe will thus indicate
increasing galvanometric negativity, which will reach a
maximum value at the moment of contact of the probe with
the perceptive layer.</p>

<p>It will be understood that the surface electric reaction
under geotropic stimulus, which we hitherto obtained, would
be relatively feeble compared to the response obtained
with direct contact with the maximally excited perceptive
layer. When the probe passes beyond the perceptive layer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</a></span>
the electric indication of excitation will undergo decline and
final abolition. The characteristic effects described above
are to be found only under the action of gravitational
stimulus; they will be absent when the organ is held in
a vertical position and thus freed from geotropic excitation.</p>

<p>I have hitherto spoken of the excitatory effect of the
upper layer; there must be some physiological reaction
on the lower perceptive layer, though of a different
character, represented diagrammatically by vertical shading.
Had the physiological reaction on the lower side of a
radial organ been the same as on the upper, geotropic
curvature would have been an impossibility, for similar
reactions on opposite sides would, by their antagonistic
effects, have neutralised each other.</p>

<p>After this preliminary explanation, I shall give a detailed
account of the experiments and results. It is to be borne
in mind that the investigation I am going to describe presupposes
no hypothesis of geotropic action. I start with the
observed fact that an organ under the stimulus of gravity,
exhibits responsive movement. I ascertain the nature of
the underlying reaction by electric tests; I have, in my
previous works, fully demonstrated that the excitatory contractile
reaction is detected by electro-motive change of
galvanometric negativity, and the opposite expansive reaction
by a change of galvanometric positivity. With the electric
probe I ascertain whether geotropic irritation is diffuse, or
whether it is localised at any particular depth of the organ.
I map out the contour lines of physiological reaction with
its heights and depths of excitation.</p>

<p>I shall now proceed to describe the results of electric
exploration into the interior of the organ. The trouble I
foresaw, related to the irritation caused by the passage of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</a></span>
the probe, and the after-effect of wound on variation of
excitability.</p>

</div>


<h4>THE ELECTRIC PROBE.</h4>

<p>The wound-irritation is, however, reduced to a minimum
by making the probe exceedingly thin. A fine platinum
wire 0&middot;06 mm. in diameter passes through a glass tubing
drawn out into a fine capillary, and fused round one end
of the platinum wire which protrudes very slightly beyond
the point of fusion; the exploring electrode is thus insulated
except at the protruded sharp point of the platinum
wire. The length of the capillary is about 6 mm., just
long enough to pass the experimental plant-organ transversely
from one end to the other; the average diameter
of the capillary is about 0&middot;15 mm. The other end of the
platinum wire comes out of the side of the tubing and is
led to one terminal of the galvanometer, the other being
connected with an indifferent point in the organ. The
probe can be gradually pushed into the plant-organ by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</a></span>
rotation of a screw head, one complete rotation causing a
forward movement through 0&middot;2 mm. (Fig. 175).</p>

<p><i>Wound-reaction.</i>&mdash;I have shown that a prick acts as a
mechanical stimulus, and in normal excitable tissues induces
an excitatory change of galvanometric negativity. This
wound-reaction increases with the extent of the wound,
and the suddenness with which it is inflicted. On account
of the fineness of the probe, it insinuates itself into the
tissue rather than make any marked rupture; the probe
again is introduced very gradually; with these precautions
the wound-reaction is found to be greatly reduced. The
immediate effect of the prick is a negative deflection of
the galvanometer, which declines and attains a steady value
in the course of about 5 minutes.</p>

<p><i>Effect of wound on excitability.</i>&mdash;I have shewn (p. 81) that
severe wound caused by transverse section induced a temporary
abolition of irritability in <i>Mimosa</i>, but that the normal
excitability was restored in the course of an hour. A prick
from a thick pin was shown to depress temporarily the
rate of growth, the normal rate being restored after an
interval of 15 minutes (p. 202). In the case of geo-electric
excitability, the depressing effect of the passage of the
probe, I find, to disappear in the course of about 10
minutes.</p>

<p>For a choice of experimental material we have to find
specimens which are not merely geotropically sensitive, but
also exhibit large electric response under stimulus. In both
these respects the shoot of <i>Bryophyllum</i> and the flower
stalk of <i>Nymph&aelig;a</i> give good results.</p>


<h4>ELECTRIC EXPLORATION FOR GEO-PERCEPTIVE LAYER BY
MEANS OF THE PROBE.</h4>

<p><i>Experiment 185.</i>&mdash;I shall now proceed to give a detailed
account of the experiments. The first specimen employed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[Pg 485]</a></span>
was the shoot of <i>Bryophyllum</i>, one contact being made with
the side of the stem, and the other with an indifferent
point on the leaf which was always held vertical. In a
particular experiment, the probe was introduced into the
stem through 0&middot;4 mm. and a feeble galvanometric negativity
was induced as the wound-effect. After an interval of
5 minutes, this attained a steady value of -15 divisions.
On the rotation of stem through +90&deg;, the point A was
above and a very much larger deflection of -82 divisions was
obtained, being the result of summation of wound and geo-electric
effects. On restoration of the plant to vertical position
the geo-electric reaction disappeared, leaving the persistent
wound reaction of -15 divisions unchanged. The true
geo-electric reaction at a point 0&middot;4 mm. inside the stem was
thus -67 divisions which is the difference between -82 and
-15 divisions. I obtained in this manner the excitatory
reactions at different layers of the organ. The following
table gives true values of geo-electric reaction at different
layers of the stem as the probe entered it by steps of
0&middot;4 mm.</p>

<p>The results given above, typical of many others, show
that there is a definite layer in the tissue which undergoes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[Pg 486]</a></span>
maximum excitation under the stimulus of gravity, and
that this excitation irradiates with diminishing intensity in
radial directions inwards and outwards.</p>

<p><i>The geo-perceptive layer may thus be experimentally
localised by measuring the depth of intrusion of the probe
for maximum deflection of galvanometric negativity.</i></p>

<p><i>Localisation of geo-perceptive layer in</i> Nymph&aelig;a:
<i>Experiment 186.</i>&mdash;I employed the same method for the
determination of the perceptive layer of a different organ
namely, that of the flower stalk of <i>Nymph&aelig;a</i>. The electric
reaction in <i>Nymph&aelig;a</i>, even under the prevailing unfavourable
condition of the season, was moderately strong, being
about three times greater than in <i>Bryophyllum</i>. A dozen
observations made with different specimens gave very
consistent results of which the following may be taken
as typical. The probe was in this case, as in the last,
moved by steps of 0&middot;4 mm. at a time. Other examples
will be given later where readings were taken for successive
steps of 0&middot;2 mm.</p>

</table></div>

<p>It will be seen that as in <i>Bryophyllum</i>, so in <i>Nymph&aelig;a</i>,
the geo-electric excitation increased at first with increasing
depth of the tissue till at a depth of 0&middot;8 mm. of the particular
specimen the induced excitation attained a maximum<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</a></span>
value. The excitatory effect then declines till it vanished
at a depth of 2&middot;4 mm.</p>

<p>The depth of layer at which maximum excitation takes
place varies to some extent, according to the thickness of
the shoot. Thus while in a thin specimen of <i>Bryophyllum</i>
3&middot;6 mm. in diameter the geo-perceptive layer was found at
a depth of 0&middot;6 mm., it occurred at the greater depth of
0&middot;8 mm. in a thicker specimen, 5 mm. in diameter. In
<i>Nymph&aelig;a</i> also the perceptive layer was found at a depth
of 0&middot;8 mm. in a thin and at a depth of 1&middot;4 mm. in a
thick specimen.</p>

<p>Having thus succeeded in localising the geo-perceptive
layer by experimental means, it was now possible to examine
the anatomical characteristics of the layer by examining
it under the microscope. I also wished to find out from
microscopic examination, the cause of certain differences
noticed in the determinations of the perceptive layer in
<i>Bryophyllum</i> and in <i>Nymph&aelig;a</i>. In the former the probe
always encountered the maximally excited geo-perceptive
layer from whichever point of the surface it entered the
organ; this indicated that the sensitive layer in <i>Bryophyllum</i>
was continuous round the axis. In <i>Nymph&aelig;a</i>, however,
the probe occasionally missed the sensitive layer; but a
new point of entry led to successful localisation of the
perceptive layer; this was probably due to the particular
layer not being continuous but interrupted by certain gaps.</p>


<h4>MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION OF THE MAXIMALLY
EXCITED LAYER.</h4>

</div>

<p>The specimens were taken out after the electric test, and
the transverse sections made at the radial line of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</a></span>
passage of the probe. Thus in a particular experiment with
<i>Bryophyllum</i> the point of maximum geotropic excitation
was found to be at a distance of 0&middot;8 mm. from the surface.
By means of the micrometer slide in the stage and the
micrometer eye-piece, the
internal layer 0&middot;8 mm.
from the surface was
examined; the particular
sensitive layer S was recognised
as the <i>continuous</i>
'starch sheath' or
endodermis containing
unusually large sized
starch grains (Fig. 176).
These often occurred in
loosely cohering groups
of 8 to 10 particles, and
their appearance is very
different from the small
sized irregularly distributed grains in other cells.</p>

<p>Examination of the microscopic section of the flower
stalk of <i>Nymph&aelig;a</i> showed that the 'starch sheath' was not
continuous but occurred in crescents above the vascular
bundles which are separated from each other. The occasional
failure of electric detection of the perceptive layer is thus
due to the probe missing one of the crescents, which with
intervening gaps, are arranged in a circle.</p>

<p>I give below a number of experimental determinations
of the geo-perceptive layer in different specimens together
with the micrometric measurement of the distance of the
'starch sheath' from the surface, the transverse section
being made at the place where the probe entered the shoot.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</a></span>

sheath.' The theory of statoliths thus obtains strong
support from an independent line of experimental investigation.
The statolithic theory has been adversely criticised
because in simpler organs the geotropic action takes
place in the absence of statoliths. There is no doubt that
the weight of the cell contents may in certain cases be
effective in geotropic stimulation; it may nevertheless be
true that "at a higher level of adaptation, the geotropically
sensitive members of the plant-body are furnished with
special geotropic sense-organs&mdash;a striking instance of anatomico-physiological
division of labour."<a name="FNanchor_A_38" id="FNanchor_A_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>In the instances of <i>Bryophyllum</i> and <i>Nymph&aelig;a</i> given
above, the geo-perceptive layer localised by means of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</a></span>
electric probe is definitely found to be the endodermis containing
large sized starch grains.</p>


<h4>INFLUENCE OF SEASON ON GEO-ELECTRIC RESPONSE.</h4>

<p>I shall now describe certain modifications in response,
which result from the change of season and also from
condition of high temperature. Physiological reactions,
generally speaking, are much affected by different seasons;
thus the seedlings of <i>Scirpus Kysoor</i> exhibit a very rapid
rate of growth of 3 mm. per hour in August, but a
month later the growth-rate declines to only 1 mm. per
hour. I find similar depression of growth with the advance
of season in seedlings of <i>Zea Mays</i>, where a very
rapid fall in growth takes place in the course of a fortnight.
The intensity of geotropic responses, both mechanical
and electrical, of <i>Trop&aelig;olum</i> declines rapidly in the course
of a month from February to March (p. 454). The flowers
of <i>Nymph&aelig;a</i> began to appear by the end of June when
the flower stalks exhibited strong geo-electric response. But
later in the season, by July and the beginning of August,
the response underwent continuous decline, and by the end
of August the response was nearly abolished.</p>

<p>Much time had to be spent in perfecting the apparatus,
and it was not till the beginning of August
that the investigations could be properly started; the responsive
indications were, however, marked and definite,
though relatively feeble compared to those obtained at the
beginning of the season. The decline of the geo-electric
response was to a certain extent also due to the prevailing
high temperature.</p>

<p><i>Effect of high temperature.</i>&mdash;I shall in the next chapter
describe experiments which show that geotropic response
is diminished under rise of temperature. The specimens
employed for localisation of geo-perceptive layer exhibited,
as stated before, a decline of geo-electric response with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[Pg 491]</a></span>
the advance of the season. This may partly be due to
unfavourable season, and partly to high temperature. In
the middle of the season the responses were extremely
feeble on warm days, but on cool mornings they became
suddenly enhanced, to decline once more by the middle
of the day. I could sometimes succeed in enhancing
the sensitiveness by placing the specimen in a cold
chamber. It thus appeared that certain internal change
unfavourable for geo-perception takes place at high temperatures,
and that the sensitive condition could sometimes
be restored by artificial cooling. But later in the
season, the internal change, whatever it may be, had proceeded
too far, and artificial cooling did not restore the
sensitiveness of the specimen. What are the physico-chemical
concomitants which distinguish insensitive specimens,
in which the electric indications had declined almost
to the vanishing point?</p>


<h4>TEST OF INSENSITIVE SPECIMENS.</h4>

<p>I shall now describe the various physico-chemical concomitants
which accompany the condition of relative
insensibility. I have found three different tests: the electric,
the geotropic, and the microscopic, by which the sensitive
could be distinguished from the insensitive condition. The
following tests were made on insensitive specimens.</p>

<p><i>Electric test: Experiment 187.</i>&mdash;By the end of August
the geo-electric indications given by the probe had, as
stated before, almost disappeared. The tonic condition
of the specimen, <i>below par</i>, was independently revealed by
the response to prick of the probe: this, in vigorous
specimens, is by an electric response of galvanometric
negativity. But the response to prick in sub-tonic
specimens is very different. I find that when the physiological
condition of the tissue falls <i>below par</i>, the sign of
response undergoes a reversal into one of <i>galvanometric<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[Pg 492]</a></span>
positivity</i>. The same reversal under condition of sub-tonicity
was also shown to take place in growth, where under
the stimulus of light a positive acceleration took place,
instead of normal retardation of growth (p. 221). In the
present investigation, the insensitive specimens were found
to give abnormal positive electric response to the stimulus
of prick made by the probe. The prick-effect in fact often
gave me previous indication as to the suitability of the
particular specimen for exhibition of geo-electric response.</p>

<p><i>Test of geotropic reaction: Experiment 188.</i>&mdash;I took four
different specimens of <i>Bryophyllum</i> and <i>Nymph&aelig;a</i>, and
held them horizontal. These plant organs had, earlier in
the season, exhibited very strong geotropic effect, the shoot
curving up through 90&deg; in the course of ten hours or less.
But these specimens obtained later in the season exhibited
very feeble curvature, which hardly amounted to 10
degrees, even after prolonged exposure to geotropic action
for 24 hours.</p>

<p><i>Test of microscopic examination.</i>&mdash;I next made sections
of <i>Bryophyllum</i> and <i>Nymph&aelig;a</i> and on examining
them under the microscope discovered certain striking
changes. A fortnight ago the group of large starch grains
stained with iodine were the most striking feature of the
starch sheath. But now these starch grains could not be
found in any of the numerous specimens examined. The
presence of the starch grains thus appears to be associated
with the sensitiveness of the perceptive layer.</p>


<h4>REACTION AT LOWER SIDE OF THE ORGAN.</h4>

<p>There remains now the important question of the
physiological change induced on the lower side of the
horizontally laid shoot. The physiological reaction of two
sides of the organ must be different, since the upper
side exhibits contraction and the lower side expansion.
It may be urged that the effect of one of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[Pg 493]</a></span>
two sides might result from the passive yielding to the
definite reaction induced on the opposite side. Investigation
by the electric method enables us, however, to discriminate
the two reactions from each other, since the
electric response characteristic of the induced physiological
change takes place in the organ, even under condition of
restraint by which movement is prevented. We shall therefore
investigate the geo-electrical reaction on the lower side
of the securely held organ, and find out whether the
induced electric change undergoes any variation in different
layers from below upwards. There are two different ways
in which the electric explorations of the lower side of the
organ may be carried out. In the first method, the probe
is introduced from below, and successive readings for geo-electric
response taken as the probe enters the organ by
successive steps. It is understood that the true geotropic
effect is found from difference of galvanometer readings
in vertical and horizontal positions. In the second
method, the probe is introduced from above, and successive
readings for the response taken for different positions of
the probe as it enters the organ from the upper side and
comes out ultimately at the lower side. This I shall call
the <span class="smcap">METHOD OF TRANSVERSE PERFORATION</span>. The intrusion
of the probe on the upper side gives, as we have seen,
increasing negative deflection of the galvanometer which
reaches a maximum at the perceptive layer. Passage of the
probe to still greater depths give deflections which decline
to zero. But when the probe comes within the influence
of the perceptive layer of the under side, the electric
indication, as we shall presently find, undergoes a reversal.</p>


<h4>ELECTRIC EXPLORATION OF THE LOWER SIDE OF THE
ORGAN.</h4>

<p>I shall first describe the results obtained from the first
method, the probe entering the organ from the lower side.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Experiment 189.</i>&mdash;The investigation was carried out
with the stem of <i>Bryophyllum</i>, and the flower stalk of
<i>Nymph&aelig;a</i>. The probe was made to enter the organ through
0&middot;4 mm. and the geo-electric effect found, on rotation of the
flower stalk of <i>Nymph&aelig;a</i> from the vertical to the horizontal,
was a deflection of +6 divisions of the galvanometer. <i>The
change induced at the lower side by geotropic stimulus is thus
galvanometric positivity, indicative of enhancement of turgor,
and, of expansion.</i> Intrusion of the probe through 0&middot;6 mm.
gave rise to an increased positive geo-electric response.
That the sign of electric response depended on the relation
of the side of the organ to the vertical lines of gravity
was demonstrated by alternate rotation of the plant through
+90&deg; and -90&deg;, the probe remaining at a definite position.
Rotation through +90&deg; brought A above, and rotation
through -90&deg; brought A below. When the probe was in
the <i>up</i> position the geo-electric response was negative, but
when rotation through -90&deg; brought it <i>below</i>, the response
became positive. Thus with an identical contact in the
plant, the electric response underwent reversal from
negative to positive. This will be understood from the
following table.</p>

<div class='center'>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="" rules="cols">
<tr><td class='bbox'>Position of the probe inside the organ.</td><td class='bbox'>Galvanometer deflection: A <i>above</i>.</td><td class='bbox'>Galvanometer deflection: A <i>below</i>.</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>0&middot;4 mm.</td><td align='left'> - 8 divisions.</td><td align='left'> + 5 divisions.</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>0&middot;6 mm.</td><td align='left'> -16 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  "</td><td align='left'> +10 &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  "</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>It will thus be seen that physiological change induced
at any point is modified by its relation to vertical lines of
gravity. When the point is above, the induced change
is <i>negative</i>, when below, the induced change is <i>positive</i>.</p>

<p>I shall next describe the variation of effect at different
layers of the under side of the organ.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[Pg 495]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Experiment 190.</i>&mdash;A complete set of readings of the
geo-electric reaction at different layers of the organ was
taken, as the probe entered the lower side by successive
steps of 0&middot;2 mm. The following table gives the results
obtained with a specimen of <i>Nymph&aelig;a</i>.</p>

<p class="tabcap">TABLE XLIII.&mdash;ELECTRIC EXPLORATION OF DIFFERENT LAYERS ON THE

</table></div>

<p>It is thus seen that just as in the upper so also in
the lower side, the electric variation undergoes at first an
increase which attains a maximum; beyond this point the
electric change undergoes a rapid decline. The induced
electric change on the upper and lower sides are, however,
different, galvanometric <i>negativity</i> in one case and <i>positivity</i>
in the other.</p>

<p>The maximum galvanometric <i>negativity</i> of the upper
side was found to occur at the geo-perceptive layer. We
may next inquire about the anatomical characteristic of
the layer in the lower side of the organ which exhibits
the maximum galvanometric <i>positivity</i>. Microscopic section
of the specimen employed in the above experiment showed
the particular layer to be the starch crescent which lies
above the vascular bundle. Thus the same geotropic layer
which when placed above shows the maximum galvanometric<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[Pg 496]</a></span>
negativity, exhibits maximum positivity when placed below.</p>


<h4>METHOD OF TRANSVERSE PERFORATION.</h4>

<p><i>Experiment 191.</i>&mdash;I next carried out a complete exploration
of the interior of the organ along the diameter. The
probe started from the upper surface, and came out at
the lower by successive steps of 0&middot;2 mm., the corresponding
geo-electric effects being observed at each step. It has
to be borne in mind that the successive readings were
obtained by rotation from vertical to +90&deg; (A above);
the rotation was never carried out in the negative direction
through -90&deg;. But the probe entering from above
passed the central axis, and entered a region where the
galvanometric indication was transformed from negative to
positive. The following table gives the results obtained
with the flower stalk of <i>Nymph&aelig;a</i>.</p>

<p>A curve constructed from the data given above is seen
in figure 177. The diameter of the flower stalk was
6&middot;8 mm. The negative geo-electric reaction is seen to
undergo an increase till it attains a climax at the depth
of 1&middot;4 mm. It then undergoes a continuous diminution
till it becomes zero at the depth of 3 mm.; this neutral
zone extends through 1 mm. When the probe enters a
depth of 4&middot;2 mm. measured from the upper side, it enters
a region affected by the perceptive layer situated on the
under side, the opposite physiological reaction being indicated
by induced electric change of galvanometric positivity.
This positivity reaches a climax at a depth of 5&middot;4 mm.
measured from the upper side, and 1&middot;4 mm. when measured<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[Pg 498]</a></span>
from the lower side. The points of maximum positivity
and negativity are situated symmetrically on the opposite
sides of the organ. The electric variation of maximum
positivity on the lower side is comparatively feeble, less
than half the corresponding maximum negativity on the
upper side. Microscopic section showed that the geo-perceptive
layers were the same as the starch-crescents.</p>

<p>Microscopic examination showed that the electric maxima
in <i>Bryophyllum</i> coincided with the diametrically opposite
points in the continuous endodermic ring. In <i>Bryophyllum</i>
as in <i>Nymph&aelig;a</i>, the excitatory galvanometric negativity of
the upper geo-perceptive layer is greater than the induced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[Pg 499]</a></span>
positivity of the lower layer in the ratio of about
2:1. But in a depressed condition of the tissue, the
excitatory reaction is the first to disappear and the positive
reaction persists, though with diminished intensity.</p>

<p>The geo-electric distribution in vigorous specimens seems
to indicate that under the stimulus of gravity a marked
excitatory reaction (contraction) takes place in the layer
of cells contiguous to the upper geo-perceptive layer, and,
a less marked positive reaction (expansion) occurs in layers
contiguous to the lower perceptive layer.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that physiological reaction of opposite
kinds should occur on the upper and lower sides of an
organ under the identical stimulus of gravity. The
difference of reaction may conceivably be connected with
the fact that the vertical lines of gravity enter by the
upper, and leave by the lower side of the organ. The
statolithic particles rest on the inner tangential walls of
the perceptive cells of the upper layer, and on the outer
tangential walls of the lower layer. Similar difference of
physiological reactions of a polar character are also known
in responses of plants under the action of an identical
electric current; here with different ionic distributions,
contraction takes place at the kathode, and expansion at
the anode.</p>

<p>The geo-electric reactions that have been described were
obtained under unfavourable conditions of climate and of
temperature. But under better conditions the reaction
becomes very greatly enhanced, as would appear from
the following account of results which I obtained
on two separate occasions in the beginning of August.
The season had not become quite as unfavourable as
towards the end of the month, but the prevailing sultry
weather had caused great depression of the geo-electric<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[Pg 500]</a></span>
excitability. On the first occasion referred to, thunderstorm
had broken out at night, and it was refreshingly cool
in the morning. It was with the utmost surprise that I
noted the astonishing violence of the geo-electric response
which the plants gave that morning; the maximum response
hitherto obtained was about 100 divisions of the
galvanometer scale; but on the present occasion the displacement
of the plant, from vertical to horizontal position,
induced responsive deflection so great that the galvanometer
spot of light flew off the scale of 3,000 divisions. I was
at first incredulous of the results and wasted the valuable
occasion in trying to discover some hidden source of error.
Subsequent tests showed that my misgivings were groundless,
and that the extraordinary large deflection was really due
to geo-electric reaction. On the second favourable occasion,
which lasted for three hours (during the cool hours of
the morning), I was able to secure a number of important
observations. Thus displacement of the flower stalk of
<i>Nymph&aelig;a</i> through +90&deg; was immediately followed by
geo-electric response, the deflection being about 3,000
divisions of the scale. The latent period hardly exceeded
a second; the return of the plant to the vertical position was
quickly followed by electric recovery which was complete.
The above results were obtained with the same specimen
time after time without a single failure. The successive
responses showed no sign of fatigue. Another remarkable
effect was noticed during gradual increase of the angle of
inclination. Nothing happened till a critical angle was
reached, which was roughly estimated to be about 33&deg;;
when this critical angle was exceeded by a single degree,
there was a sudden precipitation of geo-electric response.
The experiments were repeated time after time with the
identical result. It appeared as if some frictional resistance
obstructed the displacement of the geotropic particles
accumulated at the basal end of the cell, and it was not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[Pg 501]</a></span>
till the organ had been tilted beyond 33&deg; that this resistance
to sliding was overcome.</p>


<h4>SUMMARY.</h4>

<p>The electric distribution induced in an organ under
the stimulus of gravity may be mapped out by means of
an exploring Electric Probe.</p>

<p>The induced galvanometric negativity of the upper side
of an organ (indicative of excitation) undergoes variation
in different layers of the organ. The excitatory
reaction attains a maximum value at a definite layer,
beyond which there is a decline.</p>

<p>The geo-perceptive layer is experimentally localised by
measuring the depth of intrusion of the probe for
maximum deflection of galvanometric negativity.</p>

<p>The geo-perceptive layer thus determined is found to
be the starch sheath which contains a number of
large-sized starch grains.</p>

<p>The power of geo-perception undergoes seasonal variation.
It is also lowered by high temperature.</p>

<p>The geo-electric response undergoes decline with growing
sub-tonicity of the specimen; such specimens exhibit
abnormal positive electric response under the stimulus of
prick and feeble curvature under geotropic stimulus. The
large-sized starch-grains, normally observed in the endodermis,
are found to disappear in specimens which have
become geo-electrically insensitive.</p>

<p>The electric response of the lower side of the organ
to gravitational stimulus is of opposite sign to that of
the upper side. The electric distribution on the lower
side exhibits variations in different layers, the maximum<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[Pg 502]</a></span>
positivity occurring at the perceptive layer. In vigorous
specimens the excitatory negative electric change on the
upper side is greater than the positive electric change on
the lower side. Depressed condition of the tissue is attended
by a relatively greater decline of the negative in
comparison with the positive.</p>

<p>The induced electric variation on the upper and on
the lower side indicates that the layers of tissue contiguous
to the upper perceptive layer undergoes contraction, while
those contiguous to the lower perceptive layer undergoes
expansion.</p>

<p>I have explained that in a dorsiventral organ, lateral
application of various stimuli induces a responsive torsion
by which the less excitable side is made to face the stimulus
(p. 403). I shall in this chapter show that the
effect of stimulus of gravity is in every respect similar to
other forms of stimulation.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 682px;">

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 179.</span>&mdash;Diagram of arrangement for torsional response under geotropic
stimulus. The less excitable upper half of pulvinus is, in the above figure, to
the left and the torsional response is clockwise.</p>
</div>


<p>The direction of force of gravity is fixed, and we have
to arrange matters in such a way that the geotropic stimulus
should act on the dorsiventral organ in a lateral
direction. In the following experiments the pulvinus of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[Pg 504]</a></span>
<i>Mimosa</i> is taken as the typical dorsiventral organ. For
lateral stimulation, the plant is placed on its side,
so that the vertical lines of gravity impinge on one
of the two flanks of the organ. In regard to this, I
shall distinguish two different positions, <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>. In the
<i>a-position</i>, the apex of the stem and the upper half of the
pulvinus are to the left of the observer, and in <i>b-position</i>,
the apex of the stem and the less excitable upper
half of the pulvinus are to the right. The arrangement
for obtaining record of the torsional response under
<i>a-position</i> is shown in figure 179.</p>

<p><i>Torsional response in a- and b-positions: Experiment
193.</i>&mdash;When the leaf is in <i>a-position</i>, the geotropic torsion
is found to be with the movement of the hands of
a clock. In the <i>b-position</i>, on the other hand, the torsion
is against the hands of a clock. In both these cases
the <i>geotropic torsion makes the less excitable upper half of
the pulvinus face the vertical lines of gravity</i>. The incident
stimulus is vertical, and it is the upper flank, consisting
of the upper and lower halves of the pulvinus (on
which the vertical lines of gravity impinge) that undergoes
effective stimulation.</p>

<p><i>Algebraical summation of geotropic and phototropic effects:
Experiment 194.</i>&mdash;We are, however, able to adduce further
tests in confirmation of the above. If the direction of the
incident geotropic stimulus is vertical, and should it
act more effectively on the upper flank, it follows that
stimulus of light acting from above would enhance the
previous torsional response due to geotropism. In the above
case, the lines of gravity and the rays of light coincide. The
effect of rays of light acting from below should, on the
other hand, oppose the geotropic torsion. The additive
effect of stimulus of light and gravity is seen illustrated
in figure 180. The first part of the curve is the record of
pure geotropic torsional movement. Light from above is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[Pg 505]</a></span>
applied at L; the rate of movement is seen to become
greatly enhanced. Light is next cut off, and the enhanced
rate induced by it is also found to disappear, the
response-curve being now due solely to geotropic action.
The effect of geotropism in opposition to phototropism
will be found in the following experiments, where the
opposing action of light of different intensities is seen to
give rise to a partial, to an exact, or to an over-balance.</p>

<h4>BALANCE OF GEOTROPIC BY PHOTOTROPIC ACTION.</h4>

<p><i>Photo-geotropic balance: Experiment 195.</i>&mdash;I shall here
describe in detail the procedure for obtaining an exact
balance. A parallel beam of light from a small arc lamp is
reflected by means of an inclined mirror, so as to act on the
pulvinus below. An iris diaphragm regulates the intensity<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[Pg 506]</a></span>
of incident light. The first part of the curve is the record
of geotropic torsional movement. Light of a given intensity
was applied below at a point marked -L (Fig. 181);
this is seen to produce an over-balance, the phototropic
effect being slightly in excess. The intensity of incident
light was continuously diminished by regulation of the diaphragm
till an exact balance was obtained as seen in the
horizontal part of the record. It is with great surprise
that one comes to realise the fact that the effect of one
form of stimulus can be so exactly balanced by that of
another, so entirely different, and that the stimulus of
gravity could be measured, as it were, in candle powers of
light! After securing the balance, light was cut off,
and the geotropic torsion became renewed on the cessation
of the counteracting phototropic action.</p>

geotropic balance. Geotropic torsion, G, is
exactly balanced by opposing action of light
-L. Application of coal gas at C, at first
caused enhancement of phototropic action
with resulting reversal. Prolonged application
induced depression of phototropic reaction,
geotropic action thus becoming
predominant.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Comparative balancing effects of white and red lights:
Experiment 196.</i>&mdash;White light was at first applied at -L in
opposition to geotropic movement. The intensity of light
was stronger than what was necessary for exact balance,
and its effect was at first to retard and then reverse
the torsional response due to geotropism. When thus overbalanced,
red glass was
interposed on the path
of light at R. As the
phototropic effect of
this light is feeble
or absent, the geotropic
torsion became
predominant as seen in
the subsequent up-curve.
The red glass
was next removed substituting
white light at
-L to act once more in opposition; the result is seen in
the final over-balance, and reversal of torsion (Fig. 182).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[Pg 507]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Effect of coal gas on the balance: Experiment 197.</i>&mdash;The
method of balance described above opens out new
possibilities in regard to investigations on the relative modifications
of geotropic and phototropic excitabilities by a
given external change. Traces of coal gas are known to
enhance the phototropic excitability of an organ while
continued absence of oxygen is found to depress it. The
experiment I am going to describe shows: (1) the enhancement
of phototropic excitability on the introduction of coal
gas, and (2) the depressing effect of excess of coal gas and of
the absence of oxygen. After obtaining the normal curve
of geotropic torsion, light was applied below at -L, and
exact balance was obtained in the course of two minutes as
seen in the top of the curve becoming horizontal. Coal
gas was now introduced
in the plant-chamber at
C. This induced an enhancement
of phototropic
effect with resulting
over-balance seen in the
reversal of torsion. This
enhancement persisted for
more than three minutes.
By this time the plant-chamber
was completely
filled with coal gas, and
the resulting depression of
phototropic action is seen
in the second upset of
the balance, this time in
favour of geotropic torsion
(Fig. 183). It would
seem that the cells which respond to light are situated
nearer the surface of the organ than those which react to
geotropic stimulus. Hence an agent which acts on the organ<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[Pg 508]</a></span>
from outside, induces phototropic change earlier than
variation in geotropism.</p>


<h4>SUMMARY.</h4>

<p>Under lateral action of geotropic stimulus, a dorsiventral
organ undergoes torsional response by which the less
excitable half of the organ is made to face the stimulus.</p>

<p>The direction of incident geotropic stimulus is the same
as the direction of vertical lines of gravity. Under geotropic
stimulus it is the upper side of the organ that
undergoes effective stimulation.</p>

<p>The effects of gravity and of light become algebraically
summated under their simultaneous action. Light may
be made to act in opposition to the stimulus of gravity.
By suitable adjustment of the intensity of light, the two
torsions become exactly balanced.</p>

<p>This state of balance is upset by any slight variation in
one of the opposing stimuli.</p>

<p>The relative modification of geotropic and phototropic
excitabilities by an external agent, is determined by the
resulting upset of the photo-geotropic balance.</p>

<h3><i>By</i><br />

<br /><span class="smcap">Sir J. C. Bose.</span></h3>


<p>I shall in this chapter investigate the effect of variation
of temperature on geotropic response. We have to
bear in mind in this connection, that for the exhibition of
geotropic curvature two conditions are necessary: (1) the
presence of a perceptive organ to undergo excitation under
the stimulus of gravity, and (2) the motility of the
organ. A motile organ, including both the pulvinated and
growing, will exhibit no geotropic effect on account of the
depression of the power of perception through seasonal or
other changes, or in the entire absence of the perceptive
organ. The organ may, on the other hand, possess the
geo-perceptive apparatus, but no visible movement can take
place in the absence of motility of the tissue.</p>

<p>As regards the modifying influence of temperature on
geotropic curvature, the effect will depend on two factors:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(1) the influence of variation of temperature on geo-perception
by the sensitive layer, and</p>

<p>(2) the modifying effect of temperature variation on
the motile reaction.</p></div>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 280px;">
<img src="images/fig-184.jpg" width="232" height="640" alt="Fig. 184." title="" /><br />
<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 184.</span>&mdash;Magnet M causes deflection of the
needle <i>n s</i>, suspended by a thin wire. Increase
of magnetisation of M increases deflection, while
decrease of magnetisation diminishes the
deflection.</p>
</div>

<p>I have in Chapter XLIII adduced facts which appear to
show that the power of geo-perception declines at high
temperatures. As regards motile reaction, we have seen
that in <i>Mimosa</i> it increases from a minimum to an
optimum temperature beyond which there is a depression
(p. 55). As the optimum temperature for geo-perception
is not necessarily the same as that for responsive curvature,
the result is likely to be very complex.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[Pg 510]</a></span></p>

<p>The case becomes simpler after the attainment of
maximum curvature. Enhanced temperature has a tendency
to diminish the tropic curvature, as we found in
the arrest and reversal of phototropic curvature under the
application of warmth (p. 393); it appears as if rise
of temperature induced a relatively greater expansion of
the contracted side of the organ.</p>

<p>I shall now describe the effect of rising temperature on
geotropic curvature in general, including torsion. A horizontally
laid shoot curves upwards under geotropic action;
a dorsiventral organ, owing to the differential excitabilities
of its upper and lower sides, places itself in the
so-called dia-geotropic position. A dorsiventral organ, moreover,
exhibits a torsional movement under lateral stimulus
of gravity.</p>

<p>In the geotropic movements we are able, as stated before,
to distinguish three different phases (cf. Fig. 161). In the
first, the movement initiated undergoes an increase; in the
second, the rate of movement becomes more or less uniform;
and in the last phase, a balance takes place
between the tropic reaction, and the increasing resistance
of the curved or twisted organ to further distortion.</p>

<p>The question now arises whether this position of
geotropic equilibrium is permanent, or whether it undergoes
modification in a definite way by variation of temperature.
I shall proceed to show that the position of equilibrium
undergoes a change in one direction by a rise, and in the
opposite direction by a fall of temperature. I shall use
the term <i>thermo-geotropism</i> as a convenient phrase to
indicate the effect of temperature in modification of
geotropic curvature and torsion.</p>

<p>I shall first deal with the effect of variation of temperature
on geotropic torsion. Under the continued action
of stimulus of gravity the torsion increases till it reaches<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[Pg 511]</a></span>
a limit; for the twisted organ resists further distortion
and a balance is struck when the twisting and untwisting
forces are equal and opposite. In this state of
equilibrium the effect of an external agent, say of variation
of temperature, will bring about an upset of the
balance. The torsion will be increased if the external agent
induces an enhancement of geotropic action; it will,
on the other hand, be decreased when it induces a
diminished reaction.</p>

<p>A physical analogy will make this point clear; imagine
a small magnetic needle
suspended by a thin
wire; the earth's directive
force is supposed to be
annulled by the well
known device of a compensating
magnet. A
second and larger magnet
M is now placed at right
angles to the suspended
needle; N will repel <i>n</i>
and attract <i>s</i>, and a
deflection will be produced,
the deflecting
force of the magnet M
being balanced by the
force of torsion of suspending
wire (Fig. 184).</p>

<p>The state of equilibrium will however be disturbed by
variation of the magnetic force of M. It is known that
a rise of temperature diminishes magnetisation while
lowering of temperature increases it. Hence the deflecting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[Pg 512]</a></span>
force of the magnet will be diminished under rise of
temperature with concomitant diminution of deflection of
the needle and the torsion of the wire. Fall of temperature,
on the other hand, will cause an increase of deflection
and of torsion. The physical illustration given above
will help us to understand how the physiological effect
of variation of temperature may bring about changes in
geotropic curvature and torsion.</p>


<h4>TROPIC EQUILIBRIUM UNDER VARYING INTENSITIES OF
STIMULUS.</h4>

<p>The following experiment will show that the position
of tropic equilibrium is not fixed but subject to variation
under changes of effective stimulation.</p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 640px;">
<img src="images/fig-185.jpg" width="610" height="290" alt="Fig. 185." title="" /><br />
<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 185.</span>&mdash;Effect of variation of intensity of light on phototropic equilibrium.
Increase of intensity of light from L to L' produces an increased positive curvature
and a new state of balance. Diminished intensity of light <i>l</i> brings about
a new balance at a lower level. The cessation of light (<i>l</i> within a circle)
restores the normal position of the organ.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Experiment 198.</i>&mdash;I have explained how a maximum
tropic curvature is induced under continued action of light.
Employing the pulvinus of <i>Erythrina indica</i> I applied
light on the upper half of the pulvinus: (1) of medium
intensity L, (2) of strong intensity L', and (3) of feeble
intensity <i>l</i>. The source of light was an arc lamp; the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[Pg 513]</a></span>
intensity of light was varied by means of a focussing lens,
which gave a parallel, a convergent or a divergent beam,
with corresponding increase or diminution of intensity of
light. Light was in each case continued till equilibrium
was reached. Inspection of figure 185 shows that the
position of equilibrium depends on the intensity of stimulation;
the balance is 'raised' under increased and 'lowered'
under decreased intensity.</p>

<p>In the case of geotropism the stimulus is constant,
but its tropic effect, we shall presently see, undergoes
variation with changing temperature.</p>


<h4>EFFECT OF VARIATION OF TEMPERATURE ON GEOTROPIC
TORSION.</h4>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 520px;">
<img src="images/fig-186.jpg" width="435" height="425" alt="Fig. 186." title="" /><br />
<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 186.</span>&mdash;Effect of variation of temperature
on geotropic torsion. Application of
warmth at H diminishes the geotropic torsion;
return to normal temperature (H)
restores the original torsion; cooling at C,
increases the geotropic torsion.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Modification of geotropic torsion: Experiment 199.</i>&mdash;The
<i>Mimosa</i> plant was placed on its side, so that the pulvinus
was subjected to lateral geotropic action. In response
to this it underwent torsion, the upper half of the pulvinus
tending to place itself so as to face the vertical lines of
gravity. This torsional response was recorded as an up-movement;
on the attainment of equilibrium the record
became horizontal. The plant was now subjected to a
cyclic variation of temperature, and the resulting variation
of torsion recorded at the same time. The temperature of
the plant chamber was gradually raised from the normal
30&deg; to 34&deg; C. and then allowed to return to the normal;
finally the temperature was lowered to 26&deg;C. Rise of
temperature was effected by means of an electrical heater
placed inside the chamber with a vessel of water placed
above it. Care has to be taken that the rise of temperature
is gradual, since a sudden variation often acts as a
stimulus. The water in the vessel not only keeps the
chamber in a humid condition but also prevents sudden
fluctuation of temperature. After the temperature had been
raised to 34&deg;C., the heating current was stopped and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[Pg 514]</a></span>
door of the plant chamber gradually opened, so as to allow
the temperature to be restored to the normal. Cooled air
was next introduced into the chamber till the temperature
fell to 26&deg;C. Figure 186
exhibits clearly the effect
of variation of temperature
on geotropic torsion.
The maximum torsion had
been attained at 30&deg;C.
and the first part of the
record is therefore horizontal.
Warmth was applied
at H, and after a
latent period of ten
minutes, the geotropic
torsion underwent a continuous
diminution till a
new state of equilibrium
was reached at 34&deg;C. This
took place shortly after
the stoppage of the heating
current at (H). On return to normal temperature the
torsional balance was restored to its original position of
equilibrium. Application of cold at C, is seen to bring
about a new state of balance with an increase of geotropic
torsion.</p>

<p>The position of geotropic equilibrium is thus seen to be
modified by variation of temperature, the tropic effect
being diminished with the rise, and enhanced with the fall
of temperature.</p>

<p>It may be thought that the phenomenon just described
may not be different from ordinary thermonasty, exhibited
by the perianth leaves of <i>Crocus</i> and <i>Tulip</i> in which
a rise of temperature induces a movement of unfolding,
and a fall of temperature brings about the opposite move<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[Pg 515]</a></span>ment
of closure. In these cases the movement is determined
solely by the natural anisotropy of the organ, and
not by the paratonic action of a directive external force.
Thus the inner side of the perianth leaves undergoes an
expansion with rise of temperature attended by the opening
of the flower; this movement of opening does not
undergo any change on holding the flower in an inverted
position.</p>

<p>But the torsional movement of the leaf of <i>Mimosa</i>, and
the induced variation of torsion under change of temperature
are not solely determined by the natural anisotropy of
the organ; it is, on the contrary, regulated by the directive
action of the stimulus of gravity. The pulvinus in
normal position does not exhibit any geotropic torsion and
in the absence of an antecedent torsion change of temperature
cannot induce any variation in it. It is only after
the pulvinus had become torsioned under the lateral action
of geotropic stimulus that a responsive variation is induced
in it by the action of changing temperature.</p>

<p>The change in torsion is, moreover, determined in
reference to the paratonic action of incident geotropic
stimulus. This will be clearly understood from the tabular
statement given below.</p>

<p class="tabcap">TABLE XLVI.&mdash;SHOWING THE EFFECT OF RISE OF TEMPERATURE ON
GEOTROPIC TORSION.</p>

<div class='center'>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="" rules="cols">
<tr><td class='bbox'>Position of the organ.</td><td class='bbox'> Geotropic effect.</td><td class='bbox'>Effect of rise of temperature.</td></tr>

</table></div>

<p>By right flank in the above table is meant the side of
the pulvinus to the right of the observer facing the leaf
of the plant held in the normal position. When the plant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[Pg 516]</a></span>
is laid on its left side in the <i>a</i>-position, the right flank
will be above and the responsive torsion under geotropic
stimulus becomes right handed or with the hands of a
clock (Cf. Fig. 179). When the plant is laid on its right side,
the left flank will be above and the geotropic torsion
becomes left handed or against the hands of the clock.</p>

<p>It will be seen from the above that in whatever way
the experimental condition may be varied, the movement
in response to variation of temperature is determined in
relation to the antecedent geotropic torsion. The geotropic
effect whether left-handed or right-handed torsion is always
diminished by the rise of temperature, and enhanced by
the fall of temperature.</p>


<h4>VARIATION OF APO-GEOTROPIC CURVATURE UNDER
THERMAL CHANGE.</h4>

<p>I shall now proceed to show that variation of temperature
not merely induces variation of geotropic torsion but
also of geotropic curvature. I shall first demonstrate the
effect of thermal change on geotropic curvature of the
shoot, and then demonstrate its effect on dia-geotropic curvature
of leaves.</p>

<p><i>Experiment 200.</i>&mdash;A specimen of <i>Trop&aelig;olum majus</i>
grown in a small flower pot, is laid on its side. Under
geotropic action the shoot becomes curved, the upper side
becoming concave and the lower side convex. The end of
the stem is attached to the recording apparatus; when
the plant is subjected to a rise of temperature, the movement
induced shows that the geotropic effect has undergone
a diminution, the curvature exhibiting a flattening; lowering
of temperature, on the other hand, increases the geotropic
curvature. Other instances of this will be found in a subsequent
chapter. The diurnal movement of the 'Praying
Palm' is a striking example of the effect of variation of
temperature in modification of geotropic curvature (p. 30).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[Pg 517]</a></span>
Rise of temperature is thus shown to diminish geotropic
torsion of dorsiventral organs, and the apo-geotropic
curvature of radial organs. We have next to study the
effect of temperature variation on the dia-geotropic equilibrium
of leaves.</p>


<h4>EFFECT OF VARIATION OF TEMPERATURE ON
DIA-GEOTROPIC EQUILIBRIUM.</h4>

<p>In the normal position of the plant, the leaf of <i>Mimosa</i>
assumes, under geotropic action, an equilibrium position
which is approximately horizontal. I shall proceed to show
that this position of equilibrium also undergoes appropriate
variation under changing temperature, the leaf undergoing
a fall during rise, and an erection during fall of
temperature.</p>

<p>I stated that the torsional response is one of the means
of recording geotropic effect and its variations. In the
ordinary position of the plant, the geotropic variation will
be indicated by the responsive up or down movement of
the leaf in a vertical plane. Taking the leaf of <i>Mimosa</i>,
we have thus the means of studying the effect of variation
of temperature by two independent means of inquiry,
namely, by record of ordinary responsive movement in a
vertical plane, and also by record of torsional response.
The variation of temperature which induces these movements
may be simultaneously recorded by means of a
differential metallic thermometer. The Multiplex Recorder
employed for this research consists of three recording
levers. A photographic reproduction of the apparatus will be
found in a subsequent chapter (see Fig. 190). The first lever
is attached to the leaf of <i>Mimosa</i> placed in the normal
position; the second lever records the torsional response
of <i>Mimosa</i> leaf, the plant being placed on its side; the
third lever attached to the differential metallic thermometer
gives a continuous record of variation of temperature.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[Pg 518]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 187.</span>&mdash;Simultaneous record (<i>a</i>) of variation of temperature, (<i>b</i>) of
up or down movement of leaf of <i>Mimosa</i>, and (<i>c</i>) of variation of torsion. Rise
of temperature is attended by fall of leaf and diminution of torsion, fall of
temperature inducing the opposite effect.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Effect of variation of temperature: Experiment 201.</i>&mdash;Special
arrangement was made for gradual variation of
temperature in the plant chamber. Two rectangular metallic
vessels each 50 &times; 30 &times; 6 cm. were placed on opposite sides<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[Pg 519]</a></span>
of the plant chamber, and warm water was made to circulate
through them; this device ensured a steady rise of temperature.
The flow of warm water was then stopped and
the plant chamber was allowed to cool down; the fall of
temperature was at first moderately rapid, but later on the
rate of cooling became extremely slow; on account of
this the temperature of the plant chamber, towards
the end of the experiment remained higher than the
normal temperature outside. The rate of rise and fall of
temperature during the entire course is illustrated in the
thermo-graphic (<i>a</i>) tracing (Fig. 187); the record (<i>b</i>) exhibits
the movement of the leaf in a vertical plane, rise of temperature
being attended by a diminution of geotropic curvature
resulting in the fall of the leaf, the fall of temperature
inducing the opposite effect. In record (<i>c</i>) is seen
the responsive variation of geotropic torsion, rise of
temperature inducing a diminution and fall of temperature
causing an enhancement of torsion. The results
obtained by diverse methods thus prove that the geotropic
effect is diminished under rise, and increased under fall of
temperature.</p>


<h4>SUMMARY.</h4>

<p>The position of equilibrium under geotropic action is
not fixed but undergoes change with variation of temperature.</p>

<p>The geotropic curvature and torsion are increased by
lowering of temperature, and decreased by rise of temperature.
This is equally true of apo-geotropic and
dia-geotropic curvatures.</p>

<h3><i>By</i><br />

<br /><span class="smcap">Sir J. C. Bose.</span></h3>


<p>The subject has long been a perplexing one, and its
literature is copious. After a good many years of experimental
investigation, I have succeeded in analysing the
main factors concerned in the many phenomena which
have been described as Nyctitropism. The results of the
researches are given in a sequence of five papers, which
may be read separately, yet will be seen as so many
chapters of what has been a single though varied investigation.</p>

<p>The different chapters are:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. Daily movements in relation to Light and Darkness.</p>

<p>2. Daily movements due to Variation of Temperature
affecting Growth.</p>

<p>3. Daily movements due to Variation of Temperature
affecting Geotropic Curvature.</p>

<p>4. The Immediate and After-effect of Light.</p>

<p>5. Diurnal Movement of the leaf of <i>Mimosa</i> due
to combined effects of various factors.</p></div>

<p>Nyctitropic movements are thus described by Jost<a name="FNanchor_A_39" id="FNanchor_A_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>:</p>

<p>"Many plant organs, especially foliage and floral leaves
take up, towards evening, positions other than those they
occupy by day. Petals and perianth leaves, for example,
bend outwards by day so as to open the flower, and inwards
at night so as to close it.... Many foliage leaves also
may be said to exhibit opening and closing movements, not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[Pg 524]</a></span>
merely when they open and close in the bud but also
when arranged in pairs on an axis, they exhibit movements
towards and away from each other. In other cases, speaking
generally, we may employ the terms <i>night position</i> and
<i>day position</i> for the closed and open conditions respectively.
The night position may also be described as the
<i>sleep position</i>." After reviewing the various theories proposed,
he proceeds to say "that a completely satisfactory
theory of nyctitropic pulvinus movements is not yet forthcoming.
Such a theory can only be established after new
and exhaustive experimental research."</p>

<p>The difficulties of the experimental reinvestigation here
called for towards clearing up and explanation of the
subject are sufficiently great; they are further increased by
the fact that these diurnal movements may be brought
about by different agencies independent of each other.
Thus in <i>Crocus</i> and in <i>Tulip</i>, the movement of opening
during rise of temperature has been shown by Pfeffer to be
due to differential growth in the inner and outer halves
of the perianth. I shall in this connection show that a
precisely opposite movement of closing is induced in
<i>Nymph&aelig;a</i> under similar rise of temperature. I shall for
convenience distinguish the differential growth under temperature
variation as <i>Thermonasty</i> proper. Again certain
leaflets open in light, and close in darkness in the so-called
sleep position. Intense light, however, produces the
'midday sleep'&mdash;an effect which is apparently similar to
that of darkness. The determining factor of these movements
is the variation of light.</p>

<p>There are other instances of diurnal movement, far more
numerous, which cannot be explained from considerations
given above. It has therefore been suggested that the
"Day and night positions may arise by the combined
action of geotropism and heliotropism. Thus Vochting
(1888) observed in the case of <i>Malva verticillatta</i>, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[Pg 525]</a></span>
the leaves, when illuminated from below, turned their
lamin&aelig; downwards during the day, but during the night
became erect geotropically. The sleep movements in leaves
and flowers, referred to above, cannot however be explained
by assuming such a combination of heliotropism and
geotropism."<a name="FNanchor_A_40" id="FNanchor_A_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>I commenced my investigation on nyctitropism five
years ago, after having perfected an apparatus for continuous
record of the movements of plants throughout day
and night. A contrivance, described further on, has been
devised for obtaining a record of diurnal variation of temperature.
I have also succeeded recently, in perfecting a
device for automatic record of variation of intensity of
light. It has thus been possible not only to obtain a
continuous record of the diurnal movement of the plant,
but also obtain simultaneous record of those changes in
the environment which might have an influence on the
daily movement. I have in this way collected several
hundred autographs of different plants throughout all
seasons of the year. The records thus obtained were
extremely diverse, and it was at first impossible to discover
any fundamental reaction which would explain the phenomenon.
While in this perplexity my attention was
directed two years ago to the extraordinary performances
of the "Praying Palm" of Faridpore, in which the
geotropic curvature of the tree underwent an accentuation
during fall of temperature, and a diminution during
rise of temperature.</p>

<p>The discovery of this new phenomenon led me to the
inquiry whether Thermo-geotropic reaction, as I may call
it, was exerted only on Palm trees, or whether it was a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[Pg 526]</a></span>
phenomenon of universal occurrence. I therefore extended
my investigation on various geotropically curved procumbent
stems of <i>Ip&#339;mia</i>, <i>Basella</i>, and of <i>Trop&aelig;olum majus</i>. Here
also I found that diurnal variation of temperature induced
a periodic movement exactly similar to that in Palm trees.</p>

<p>I next wished to find whether the Thermo-geotropic
reaction observed in stems was also exhibited by lateral
organs such as leaves, which being spread out in a
horizontal direction are subjected to the stimulus of gravity.
I found that in a large number of typical cases, a periodic
movement took place which was exactly similar to that
given by rigid trees and trailing stems. A standard
curve was thus obtained which was found to be characteristic
not only of trees and herbs, but also of leaves.
The stem and leaves <i>fell</i> continuously with the rise of
temperature, from the minimum at about 6 in the morning
to the maximum at about 2 p.m. They erected themselves
with falling temperature from 2 p.m. to 6 a.m. next
morning.</p>

<p>In the diurnal record of <i>Mimosa</i> I met, however, with
an unaccountable deviation from the standard curve, for
which I could not for a long time find an adequate explanation.
Subsequent investigations showed that the deviation
was due to the introduction of additional factors of variation,
namely of immediate and after-effects of light.</p>


<h4>COMPLEXITY OF THE PROBLEM.</h4>

<p>I have already referred to the great difficulty of explanation
of nyctitropism from the fact that the diurnal
movements may be brought about by different agencies
independent of each other. It is, moreover, not easy to
discriminate the effect of one agency from that of the
other.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[Pg 527]</a></span></p>

<p>The combined effects of different factors will evidently
be very numerous. This will be understood from consideration
of the number of possible combinations with only
two variables, geotropism and phototropism. The effect of
geotropism may be strong <i>G</i>, or feeble, <i>g</i>. Similarly we
may have strong effect of light <i>L</i>, or feeble effect of light
<i>l</i>. Light may exert positive phototropic action +<i>L</i> or
negative action -<i>L</i>. Thus from two variables we obtain
the following eight combinations:</p>

<p class="center">
<i>G</i> + <i>L</i>; <i>G</i> - <i>L</i>; <i>G</i> + <i>l</i>; <i>G</i> - <i>l</i>;<br />
<i>g</i> + <i>L</i>; <i>g</i> - <i>L</i>; <i>g</i> + <i>l</i>; <i>g</i> - <i>l</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>The number of possible variables are, however, far
more numerous as will be seen from the following:</p>

<p><i>Geotropism.</i>&mdash;The effect of geotropic stimulus on horizontally
placed organs is one of erection. But this stimulus,
which is constant, cannot by itself give rise to
periodic movements. It has however been shown that
variation of temperature has a modifying influence on
geotropic curvature (p. 519).</p>

<p><i>Phototropism.</i>&mdash;The action of unilateral light is to induce
a tropic curvature, which in some cases is positive,
in others negative (p. 386). In addition to these effects
induced during the incidence of light, we have to take
account of the after-effects on the cessation of light.</p>

<p><i>After-effects of light.</i>&mdash;I find two very different effects,
depending on the intensity and duration of previous illumination.
Of these the most important is the phenomenon
of 'overshooting' which occurs on the cessation of light
of long duration. This particular reaction, to be fully
described, will be found to offer an explanation of certain
anomalous effects in diurnal movement.</p>

<p><i>Periodic variation of turgor.</i>&mdash;I have shown (p. 39)
that artificial enhancement of turgor in the plant induces<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[Pg 528]</a></span>
an erectile movement of the leaf of <i>Mimosa</i>, diminution
of turgor inducing the opposite movement of fall. Kraus
and Millardet have shown that a diurnal variation of
tension takes place in the shoot of all plants, which is
presumably indicative of variation of turgor. This variation
of turgor in the shoot must have some effect on the
lateral leaves. But the leaves are subjected to conditions
which are absent in the stem. The erect stem is, for
example, free from geotropic action, whereas the lateral
leaf is subject to it. The effect of turgor variation in the
shoot on the movement of leaves may be, and often is,
overpowered by the predominant geotropic action. I shall,
later on, refer to this question in greater detail.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 188.</span>&mdash;Arrest of pulsatory movement of leaflet of <i>Desmodium gyrans</i> by
light from above and gradual restoration on cessation of light. Up-movement
represented by up-curve.</p>
</div>


<p><i>Autonomous movements: Experiment 202.</i>&mdash;The lateral
organ, say the leaf or leaflet, may have an autonomous
movement of its own. In some, the autonomous movement
may be relatively quick; the complete pulsation in
<i>Desmodium gyrans</i> may be as short as a minute or so. I
find that this autonomous movement becomes modified or
even arrested by the paratonic effect of light. This is
seen in figure 188, where light applied from above is
seen to arrest the pulsation; the normal activity is, however,
restored on the stoppage of light.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[Pg 529]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Epinasty and Hyponasty: Experiment 203.</i>&mdash;There are
other autonomous movements which are relatively slow.
Even in an erect stem there may be a to and fro oscillation.
In such a case the effect of an external stimulus, say of
light, is one of algebraical summation. The following is
the summary of results of unilateral action of light on
the nutating hypocotyl of a pea seedling:</p>

<div class='center'>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 189.</span>&mdash;Effect of unilateral light on hyponastic movement of the cotyledon
of <i>Pepo</i>. Application of light indicated by arrows; light acting from below
retards, acting from above accelerates the movement. The last part of the
curve in each shows recovery on the stoppage of light.</p>
</div>

<p>Figure 189 exhibits the effect of light applied alternately
above or below the cotyledon of <i>Cucurbita Pepo</i>. On
account of the more rapid growth of the lower side, the
cotyledon was exhibiting a hyponastic up-movement.
Application of light from above enhanced the existing rate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[Pg 530]</a></span>
of movement, whereas light acting from below retarded the
movement. Here we have instances of photo-hyponastic
modification of natural movement. Similarly epinastic
organs will, normally speaking, have their natural down
movement retarded by light from above, and accelerated
by light from below. If the periodicity of the autonomous
movements coincides with the periodicity of the external
stimulus, the resulting movement will be determined by
algebraical summation; it will be very pronounced when
the two effects are concordant. If the two periodicities do
not agree, the interference effects will become extremely
complicated.</p>

<p><i>Positive thermonasty.</i>&mdash;Rise of temperature inducing differential
growth brings about the <i>closure</i> of the flower. Fall
of temperature on the other hand induces a movement of
opening. Example of this has already been given in the
responsive movement of <i>Nymph&aelig;a</i>.</p>

<p><i>Negative thermonasty.</i>&mdash;The opposite type of movement
is exhibited by <i>Crocus</i> and <i>Tulip</i>. Pfeffer has shown that
a rise of temperature induces in these flowers, a quicker
rate of growth of the inner side of the perianth. Rise of
temperature thus induces a movement of opening, and a
fall of temperature brings about the opposite movement of
closure. I shall presently describe the effects of both
positive and negative thermonasty, in diurnal movements
of flowers.</p>

<p><i>Thermo-geotropism.</i>&mdash;I have already described the accentuation
of geotropic curvature during the fall, and a
flattening of curvature during the rise of temperature
(p. 519). The influence of this factor on diurnal movement
will presently be treated in fuller detail.</p>

<p>There are thus more than ten variables, and the resulting
effect due to their combinations will exceed a thousand.
This will explain why attempts at explanation of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[Pg 531]</a></span>
phenomenon of nyctitropism had hitherto proved so
baffling. It is indeed a difficult task to disentangle the
full explanation of each given case in the vast complexity.
It is, however, possible, by a process of judicious elimination,
to reduce the difficulties which at first appear
to be insurmountable.</p>

<p>In the periodic movement of plants there are several
factors which are predominant, others being of minor
importance. The important factors are the effects of light
and darkness, of variation of temperature on differential
growth, and of thermal variation on geotropic curvature.</p>

<p>For facility of treatment, I shall first take the three
ideal types: (1) where the variation of light is the important
factor, (2) where the movement is due to differential growth
under variation of temperature, and (3) where thermal
variation induces changes in geotropic curvature. I shall
then take up the movement of the leaf of <i>Mimosa</i> where
the combined effects of numerous factors give rise to a
highly complex diurnal curve. There remains now the
difficulty of discriminating the three types which approximate
to the ideal.</p>


<h4>DISCRIMINATING TESTS FOR CLASSIFICATION.</h4>

<p><i>Predominant effect of light and darkness.</i>&mdash;Turning first
to the case where light exerts a predominant influence,
the obvious test of keeping the plant in continuous darkness
or continuous light is not practicable. One would
think that if the movement was due to periodic variation
of light, such movement would disappear under constant
light or darkness. But owing to the persistence of after-effect,
the periodic movement previously acquired is continued
for a long time.</p>

<p>There is, however, another possibility of discrimination.
The effect of variation of light will be most marked at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[Pg 532]</a></span>
the two periods, early in the morning when the light
appears, and in the evening when it disappears. In the
tropics there is little twilight; in Calcutta, the sun rises
in summer at about 5-30 a.m., and sets at 6-30 p.m. In
winter the sun rises an hour later, and the sunset is an
hour earlier. The average dawn may therefore be taken
approximately at 6 a.m., and the average sunset at 6 p.m.
Unlike the diurnal variation of temperature which is gradual,
the change from light to darkness or from darkness to
light is very abrupt. If we succeed next in obtaining
a continuous curve of the diurnal movement of the
plant, the phototropic action would be evidenced by some
flexures of the curve in the morning and towards evening.</p>

<p>The other two types of daily movement depend on
the diurnal variation of temperature, and there is some
difficulty in distinguishing the effect of variation of light
from that of temperature, since both are connected with
the appearance and disappearance of the sun.</p>

<p><i>Diurnal variation of light and of temperature.</i>&mdash;There
are certain differences, however, which enable us to distinguish
the two variations. Light appears in the morning,
say at 6 a.m., becomes most intense at noon; after 4 p.m. the
light wanes, and darkness sets in quickly after 5 p.m.
and remains persistent till next morning. The course
of variation of temperature is somewhat different. The
minimum temperature is attained in my green house at
about 5 a.m. in summer, and at about 7 a.m. in winter.
The maximum temperature is reached at about 3 p.m.
in summer, and about 1 p.m. in winter. The range of
daily variation in summer may be taken to be from
about 23&deg; C. to 34&deg; C.; in winter it is from 16&deg; C. to about
29&deg; C. The above gives the normal variation and not the
sudden fluctuations that occur during uncertain weather
conditions.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[Pg 533]</a></span></p>

<p>The temperature remains constant for nearly an hour
during the period of transition from falling to rising
temperature, and <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>. The average period of minimum
temperature may be taken at 6 a.m., which I shall
distinguish as the <i>thermal-dawn</i>. The average period for
maximum temperature, the <i>thermal-noon</i>, is at 2 p.m. Variations
from these average periods at different seasons do
not amount to more than an hour.</p>

<p>The light-dawn and thermal-dawn are more or less
coincident, while the thermal-noon is two hours later than the
light-noon. A change in the diurnal curve of movement due
to thermal variation will thus be detected at about 2 p.m.
If the curve of daily movement of the plant-organ closely
resemble the diurnal thermographic curve, there can then
be no doubt of the causal relation of variation of temperature
in the production of the periodic movement. Two
different classes of phenomena, as already stated, arise
however from the variation of temperature, <i>thermonasty</i>
and <i>thermo-geotropism</i>. In the former, the movement is
autonomous, and determined in relation to the plant; in the
latter, the movement is related to the direction of external
stimulus of gravity. Further tests will be given later, to
distinguish the phenomenon of Thermonasty from that of
Thermo-geotropism.</p>

<p>I shall in the succeeding papers describe the principal
types of diurnal movements as sketched above. The success
of the investigation greatly depends on the elaboration of
automatic apparatus of precision, which gives a continuous
record of the diurnal movement of different plant organs.
The description of this Nyctitropic Recorder will be given
in the next paper.</p>


<h4>SUMMARY.</h4>

<p>The obscurities in the nyctitropic movement of plants
arises from the presence of numerous complicating factors.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[Pg 534]</a></span></p>

<p>In the diurnal movement of plants the most important
factors are the effects of light and darkness, of variation
of temperature on differential growth, and of thermal
variation on geotropic curvature.</p>

<p>These three classes of phenomena may be discriminated
from each other by the following tests. The effects of light
and darkness are most pronounced in the morning when
light appears, and in the evening when light disappears.
A pronounced flexure in the diurnal curve at these periods
indicates the dominant character of the phototropic action.
The effect of light can also be distinguished from that
of temperature from the fact that the period of
maximum intensity of light, or <i>light-noon</i>, is about two
hours earlier than the <i>thermal-noon</i>, at which the
temperature is maximum.</p>

<p>A flexure of the diurnal curve about thermal noon,
at which an inversion takes place from rise to fall of
temperature, indicates the effect of temperature. The additional
test of the effect of temperature is furnished
by the close resemblance of the diurnal curve of
the plant with the thermographic record for 24 hours.</p>

<p>Two different classes of phenomena arise from
variation of temperature&mdash;Thermonasty and Thermo-geotropism.
In the former the movement is autonomous and
determined by the differential growth-activity of the
two sides of an anisotropic organ. In the latter the
movement is not in relation to the plant but directed
by the external stimulus of gravity.</p>

<p>The nyctitropic movements of the leaflet of <i>Cassia
alata</i> and of the terminal leaflet of <i>Desmodium gyrans</i>
furnish us with typical examples of the recurrent effects
of light and darkness. The petiole of <i>Cassia</i> contains a
number of paired leaflets each of which is about 5 cm.
long and 2&middot;5 cm. broad. The leaflets are extremely
sensitive to light; at night each pair of leaflets fold themselves
in a forward direction (see Fig. 150). With the
appearance of light they open at first in a lateral direction;
later on there is a twist of the pulvinus by which the
inner surface of the leaflets faces light coming from above
(p. 405). I shall show that the diurnal movements of the
leaflets are predominantly due to phototropic action.</p>

<p>Before proceeding further it will be necessary to give
a general description of the experimental method employed,
and of the apparatus by which diurnal movements are
recorded.</p>


<h4>EXPERIMENTAL ARRANGEMENTS.</h4>

<p>The diurnal record is often taken continuously for
several days, and it is therefore necessary to take precautions
against the disturbing effect of watering the plant.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[Pg 536]</a></span>
The record is also liable to be affected by the twist induced
by light when it acts on one side of the organ.</p>

<p><i>Irrigation.</i>&mdash;There is, as is well known, a periodic
variation of turgor in the plant. This normal variation
is, however, disturbed by watering the plant at irregular
intervals. Precaution against this was taken by placing
the three flower pots on a long trough filled with water
(Fig. 190). The height of water in the trough is always
maintained constant by a syphon.</p>

<p><i>Vertical illumination.</i>&mdash;The direction of sunlight changes
from morning to evening, and the leaves exhibit appropriate
phototropic movements or torsions under changing directions
of lateral light. In order to obviate this, a special
chamber was constructed, which allowed light from the
sky to fall vertically on the plant through a sheet of
ground glass which covered the roof. The sides and the base
of the chamber are impervious to light. A narrow slit
covered with red glass allows inspection of the curve
during the process of record.</p>

<p><i>The Ventilator.</i>&mdash;A revolving ventilator, acted on by the
wind, sucks the air away from the chamber, thus ensuring
constant supply of fresh air, without causing any disturbances
of the record.</p>


<p><i>The Recorder.</i>&mdash;The Oscillating Recorder employed is of
the quadruplex type carrying four recording plates
(Fig. 190). The first lever records the daily variation of
temperature. The other three are attached to three different
specimens of the same plant, or to three different plants. In
the former case, three records are obtained of the same
species of plant, under identical external condition. If
they agree in all essentials, the periodic curve may be taken
as characteristic of the given plant. A very great saving of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[Pg 537]</a></span>
time is thus ensured, and it is thus possible to obtain
characteristic curves of numbers of different species of
plants within the short period of a season. The quadruplex
recorder enables us also to obtain simultaneous records
under identical external condition of leaves of different age
of the same plant, or of leaves of three different species
of plant. I have for the last five years taken records of
numerous plants at all seasons of the year. The autograph
of the plant is often so characteristic that it is possible
to name it by mere inspection of its daily record.</p>

two levers are shown in the figure to record movements of leaves, the third

to a differential thermometer, T, records diurnal variation of temperature.</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[Pg 538]</a></span></p>
<p><i>Thermograph.</i>&mdash;For obtaining a continuous record of
diurnal variation of temperature, I use a compound strip,
T, made of brass and steel. Variation of temperature
induces a curvature of the compound strip which is recorded
by means of the attached lever. The oscillation of the plate
takes place once in fifteen minutes, and the successive dots
thus produced give time records of the diurnal curve.
The record thus consists of a series of dots. An
additional device makes the plate oscillate three times in
rapid succession at the end of each hour; the hourly dot
is thus thicker than others. The movement of the plant,
corresponding to the particular variation of temperature
at any period, may thus be easily determined. I shall
now give a typical example of diurnal movement induced
by variation of light and darkness.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">DIURNAL MOVEMENT OF THE LEAFLET OF <i>Cassia alata</i>.</p>

<p>The leaflet of <i>Cassia alata</i> exhibits a movement of
opening in the morning, and it remains outspread
throughout the day. It then begins to close before
evening and remains closed throughout the night. The
problem before us is to find out the relative importance
of variation of temperature and of light in the
diurnal movement of the leaflets.</p>

<p>In the daytime the light is increasing till midday;
there is, on the other hand, a rapid decline of light after
5 p.m. and uninterrupted darkness at night. As regards
temperature there is a continuous rise from morning till
the thermal noon at 2 p.m., after which the fall of
temperature is continuous till next morning. The opening
of the leaflets in the daytime may therefore be due
to the summated effects of rising temperature and increasing
light, the closure, on the other hand, being due to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[Pg 539]</a></span>
falling temperature, and to darkness. The individual effect
of each of these factors is not known and it is therefore
necessary to determine the effects of variation of temperature
and of light.</p>


<p class="center">EFFECT OF VARIATION OF TEMPERATURE.</p>

<p><i>Experiment 204.</i>&mdash;The plant was enclosed in a glass
chamber and exposed to diffuse light. The experiment was
commenced at midday, when the leaflets were open; the
light was kept uniform while temperature was artificially
increased by means of an electric heater placed in the
chamber, and decreased by introducing cold air into the
plant chamber. One of the leaflets was attached to the
recording lever and its movement, up or down, indicated
the movement of opening or closure. The records showed
that rise of temperature induces a movement of closure,
while that of fall brings about the movement of opening.</p>


<p class="center">EFFECT OF VARIATION OF LIGHT.</p>

<p><i>Experiment 205.</i>&mdash;This experiment
was also carried out at midday, when
the leaflets were open. The horizontal
record in figure 191 represents
the stationary expanded condition
of the leaflet; a black cloth
was put over the glass chamber at
1 p.m., and the effect of darkness
was recorded for one hour. Darkness
is seen to initiate a movement of
closure which increased at a rapid
rate; the black cloth was removed
after an hour, and the movement of
opening under light was completed in
the course of five quarters of an
hour. It is thus seen that the
leaflets are extremely sensitive to the
action of light.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[Pg 540]</a></span></p>

<p>The experiments that have just been described on
the effects of rise of temperature, and of light, show
that they are antagonistic to each other. In the forenoon
the opening movement under light has to be carried out
against the closure movement due to rise of temperature.
Light, therefore, is the predominant factor in the diurnal
movement of the leaflets of <i>Cassia</i>. The closure effect
of darkness at night, on the other hand, overpowers the
tendency of movement of opening due to fall of temperature.</p>

</div>

<h4>DIURNAL MOVEMENT OF THE LEAFLET OF <i>Cassia alata</i>.</h4>

<p><i>Experiment 206.</i>&mdash;I next obtained the diurnal record of
the leaflet, from 4 p.m. till 1 p.m. next day. The leaflets
remain open from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. and the record of
this period is therefore omitted. In the diurnal record
(Fig. 192) the first thick dot was made at 4 p.m. and
successive thick dots are at intervals of an hour, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[Pg 541]</a></span>
thinner dots being at intervals of 15 minutes. It will be
seen that a rapid movement of closure was initiated at
5 p.m. when the light is undergoing a rapid diminution.
The movement of closure is completed at about 9 p.m.
The leaflets remain closed till 5 a.m. next morning, after
which they begin to open; this opening may commence
even an hour earlier. It should be borne in mind in
this connection, that since light and rise of temperature
are antagonistic in their reactions, the effects of light and
fall of temperature would be concordant; and the opening
in the early hours may possibly be hastened by the low
temperature in the morning. The leaflets open to their
utmost by 9 a.m., and they remain open till the afternoon.
The plant is so extremely sensitive to light that any slight
fluctuation is followed by responsive movement of the
leaflet. Thus the transitory passage of a cloud is marked
in the record by a short-lived closure movement.</p>

</div>

<h4>DIURNAL MOVEMENT OF THE TERMINAL LEAFLET OF
<i>Desmodium gyrans</i>.</h4>

<p>Both the petiole, and the terminal leaflet of this plant
exhibit very marked nyctitropic movement. The petiole is
raised and becomes almost erect in the evening, while the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[Pg 542]</a></span>
pulvinus of the terminal leaflet exhibits a sharp curvature
downwards (Fig. 193).</p>

<p><i>Experiment 207.</i>&mdash;The petiole was held fixed, and the
terminal leaflet attached to the recording lever. I have
already explained that light falling on the pulvinus from
above, induces an up-movement of the leaflet, which is
thus erected under light of moderate intensity. If the light
be strong, the transversely conducted excitation induces a
partial neutralisation; very intense light may even cause
a reversal into down-movement. Under natural conditions,
day-light acting from above induces an up-movement;
darkness, on the other hand, induces a rapid movement of
fall. The leaflets sometimes exhibit autonomous pulsations;
but the diurnal movement is very strong and the daily
curve appears as a single large pulse on which smaller
autonomous pulsations may become superposed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 194.</span>&mdash;Diurnal record of the terminal leaflet of <i>Desmodium gyrans</i>. Up-curve

</div>

<p>The diurnal curve (Fig. 194) exhibits a sudden flexure
at about 5 p.m. on the rapid waning of afternoon light
till, by 6-30 p.m., it becomes closely pressed against the
petiole, by the rapid fall of the leaflet. The discriminating
test, between effects of variation of temperature and of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[Pg 543]</a></span>
light, lies in the fact that the flexure of the diurnal curve
takes place in the former at about 2 p.m. when temperature
undergoes change from ascent to descent; in the case
of light, the change in the intensity of light begins to be
marked about three hours later. In the diurnal curve of
<i>Desmodium</i> the record shows little change at 2 p.m., showing
that the leaflet is not affected to any great extent by the
variation of temperature; it is, however, strongly affected
by change in light as seen in the rapid closure movement
about 5 p.m. The leaflet remains tightly closed throughout
the night and begins to open and spread out early in the
morning at about 5 a.m. This up-movement is also very
rapid and the leaflet assumes the fullest outspread position
by 7 a.m. It remains in this position till the afternoon,
after which the cycle becomes repeated. As the leaflet is
very sensitive to light, the position of equilibrium of the
leaflet is liable to be disturbed by the slightest variation
of light and the fluctuation of light from the sky
often gives rise to a wavy outline in the record. The
leaflet, moreover, has a tendency to exhibit rhythmic
pulsations.</p>

<p>In the leaflets of <i>Cassia</i> and <i>Desmodium</i>, the daily
movement is thus brought about by the predominant action
of recurrent light and darkness.</p>


<h4>MIDDAY SLEEP.</h4>

<p>I shall here briefly recapitulate the results given in
greater detail in an earlier paper (p. 352). I have shown that
the midday closure of leaflets is brought about by the
excitatory action of strong sunlight. The responsive
movement of motile pulvinus under diffuse stimulus is
determined by the greater contraction of the more excitable
half of the organ. Under the action of the midday
sun the leaflets of <i>Mimosa</i> undergo a folding upwards,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[Pg 544]</a></span>
whereas the leaflets of <i>Averrhoa carambola</i> a folding
downwards. The explanation of the difference lies in
the fact that in the leaflets of <i>Mimosa</i> it is the upper
half, and in <i>Averrhoa</i> it is the lower half of the
pulvinule, that is the more excitable. This difference may
be demonstrated by the action of diffuse electric shock
under which the leaflets of <i>Mimosa</i> exhibit an upward,
and those of <i>Averrhoa</i> a downward, closure. I have
also shown that conduction of excitation takes place across
the pulvinule; hence the strong excitation caused by sunlight
becomes internally diffused, and brings about the
responsive movements, the direction of which is determined
by the more excitable half of the pulvinule.</p>


<h4>SUMMARY.</h4>

<p>Rise of temperature induces a movement of closure of
the leaflet of <i>Cassia</i>, fall of temperature inducing the
opposite movement.</p>

<p>Artificial darkness induces a closure of the leaflets, the
closure being completed in the course of an hour. On
readmission of light, the leaflets become fully expanded
in the course of one hour and a quarter. The leaflets
are extremely sensitive to light, closure movement being
induced by the transitory passage of a cloud.</p>

<p>The effect of rise of temperature is antagonistic to the
action of light. The movement of opening during the course
of the day is due to the effect of light overpowering the
effect of rise of temperature.</p>

<p>Under daily variation of light and darkness, the
movement of closure is initiated at about 5 p.m., when
the light is undergoing a rapid diminution. The movement
of closure is complete by 9 p.m. The leaflets remain closed
till about 5 a.m. next morning, after which they begin to
open and become fully expanded by 9 a.m.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[Pg 545]</a></span></p>

<p>The terminal leaflet of <i>Desmodium gyrans</i> exhibits
a diurnal movement which is very similar to that of <i>Cassia</i>.
It begins to open early in the morning and remains outspread
during the whole day; the leaflet exhibits a rapid
down-movement after 5 p.m. and becomes closely pressed
against the petiole in the course of about two hours.</p>

<p>The midday sleep of leaflets of <i>Mimosa</i> and <i>Averrhoa</i>
is due to the excitatory action of strong sunlight on the
pulvinule, the more excitable half becoming contracted
under excitation. In <i>Mimosa</i> leaflets it is the upper, and
in <i>Averrhoa</i>, it is the lower half of the pulvinule that
is the more excitable. It is in consequence of this that
the diffuse excitation of strong sunlight causes the leaflets
of <i>Mimosa</i> to fold upwards, those of <i>Averrhoa</i> to fold
downwards.</p>

<br /><span class="smcap">Lalit Mohan Mukerjee</span>.</h3>


<p>It has been stated that there are two classes of diurnal
movements caused by variation of temperature; one of
these is due to differential growth induced on two sides
of the organ, and the other is brought about by the
induced variation of geotropic curvature. The former may
be distinguished as <i>Thermonastic</i>, and the latter as
<i>Thermo-geotropic</i> movement. Before laying down the criteria
to distinguish the one class of phenomenon from the other,
it would be advisable to refer to the somewhat arbitrary
distinction that has been made between nastic and tropic
reactions.</p>


<h4>TROPIC AND NASTIC MOVEMENTS.</h4>

<p>The explanation, which I shall offer about the night
and day movements in plants, has been reached through
the study not only of pulvinated, but also of growing and
fully grown organs. A distinction is made between the
movement due to growth, and the 'variation movement'
due to change of turgor. I have shown (p. 239) that the
same diminution of turgor which induces a contraction in
a pulvinus, also induces in a growing organ an incipient
contraction, and retardation of growth. Enhancement of
turgor, on the other hand, induces in both the opposite
effect of expansion. Unilateral stimulus induces curvature,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[Pg 547]</a></span>
and there is no essential difference in the production of
such curvatures in pulvinated, growing, and fully grown
organs. The exhibition of nyctitropic movement by the
fully grown, and rigid 'Praying Palm' is a striking demonstration
of the unity of response of all plant organs.</p>

<p>As regards the distinction between the tropic and nastic
movements, it will be found that there is no sharp line
of demarcation between the two. A movement is said to
be <i>tropic</i>, when unilateral stimulus acts on an organ and
induces in it a directive movement. Curvature induced by
diffused stimulus on a dorsiventral or anisotropic organ
(with differential excitabilities of the two halves) is termed
<i>nastic</i>. Daylight is supposed to act diffusely (<i>i.e.</i>, equally
on all sides) on leaves; this is, however, not strictly true,
since the light from sky above is stronger than from
ground below. Moreover, the tropic action of unilateral
light may become nastic by internal diffusion of excitation.
This is seen in the response of the pulvinus of <i>Mimosa</i>
to light acting from above. The leaf at first moves
upwards towards the stimulus, the response being positively
phototropic. But under the continued action of light,
excitation becomes internally diffused, and the leaf undergoes
a fall by the greater contraction of the more excitable
lower half of the organ (p. 331). No sharp distinction
can therefore be made between the movements of growth
and of variation, between tropic and nastic curvatures.</p>

<p>The employment of the term 'nastic' is, however,
convenient when used in a well-defined and restricted
sense. "We speak of tropism when the organ takes up a
resting position definitely <i>related to the effective stimulus</i>.
Nastic movements, on the other hand, are curvatures which
bring about a particular position <i>in relation to the plant</i>, and
not to the direction of the stimulus".<a name="FNanchor_A_41" id="FNanchor_A_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> It will sometimes
be necessary, in the course of this paper, to discriminate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[Pg 548]</a></span>
the movements which are autonomous from others which
are paratonic, <i>i.e.</i>, brought about by external stimulus, to
the former class belongs a large number of automatic
activities ranging from the quick pulsations of <i>Desmodium
gyrans</i> to the slow movements, exhibited by epinastic and
hyponastic organs. Under the category of nastic movements
may also be included those of the flower of <i>Crocus</i>
and <i>Tulip</i>, in which variation of temperature induces
differential growth on two sides of the organ. The direction
of the movement, though initiated by change of temperature,
is determined by the difference of growth-activity
on the two sides. In these instances of nastic movement,
the induced curvature is in relation of the plant; the
opening of the flower due to rise of temperature will remain
the same, whether the flower be kept in an erect or in
an inverted position. Had the movement, on the other
hand, been paratonic, that is to say, due to the external
stimulus of gravity, the responsive movement would have
been determined not in relation to the plant but to the
direction of external force of gravity.</p>

<p>In the description of direction of responsive movements,
confusion is likely to arise unless the point of view
be carefully defined. An up-movement of a leaf or a
petal means approach towards the growing point of the
axis. This may be variously described as movement of
closure or of folding. A down-movement may, on the
other hand, be described as a movement of opening or of
unfolding. If the plant be held inverted, two different
effects will be noticed depending on the character of the
movement, whether nastic or tropic. In the case of nastic
movement, the former up-movement in erect position would
appear, on inversion of the plant, to be a down-movement;
but in relation to the plant the closure movement will
remain closure movement, whether the plant be held in
the normal position or upside down. If, on the other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[Pg 549]</a></span>
hand, the direction of movement be determined by
the paratonic effect of external stimulus, gravity for
example, an up-movement due to fall of temperature will
continue to be an up-movement, whether the plant be
held in its normal or inverted position. The responsive
movement in relation to the plant will, however, be
different; the closure movement will, on inversion, be
reversed into a movement of opening. The reversal of
closure into an opening movement or <i>vice vers&acirc;</i> will thus
be a test of the paratonic effect of external stimulus.</p>

<p>We may thus distinguish thermonastic from thermo-geotropic
action by the following tests:</p>

<p>1. Thermonastic movements are, generally speaking, due
to differential growth, and are therefore characteristically
present in growing organs. Thermo-geotropic action is
independent of growth.</p>

<p>2. Thermonastic movements take place in relation to
the plant, and is not determined by external force of
a directive nature. Opening or closing movement will
remain unchanged after inversion of the plant. But thermo-geotropic
reaction being determined by the external stimulus
of gravity, becomes reversed on inversion of the plant.
Closure movement is thus converted into opening movement,
and <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>.</p>

<p>I shall now take up the diurnal movement due to
variation of growth induced by change of temperature. Of
this the flower of <i>Nymph&aelig;a</i> furnishes an example.</p>

</div>

<p>The flower of <i>Nymph&aelig;a</i> remains closed during the day
and opens at night. Figures 195 and 196 are from
photographs of the day and night positions of the flower.
The closure and opening movements of this flower have
been regarded as being mainly due to recurrent variations
of light and darkness.<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> If the opening be due to
darkness, closure of the flower should take place in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[Pg 551]</a></span>
morning with the appearance of light. But the flowers
often remain open till ten or eleven in the forenoon. I
have sometimes succeeded in keeping the flower open for
greater part of the day by lowering the temperature of
the plant-chamber. The movement of the flower thus appeared
to be associated with variation of temperature rather
than of light.</p>


<p><i>Action of light: Experiment 208.</i>&mdash;I investigated the
effect of light on the movement of opening or of closing
of the flower. One of the petals
was attached to the recording
lever; light from an arc lamp
was made to act diffusely on the
petal; this was done by means of
two inclined mirrors by which
the divergent horizontal beam of
light was thrown on the upper
and lower sides. The record in
figure 197 shows that light induced
a movement of opening, followed
by closure in darkness. Since light
induces a movement of opening,
and darkness brings about a
closure, the opening of the flower
at night could not be due to darkness. We have therefore
to look for a different cause for the diurnal movement of
the flower.</p>

<p><i>Effect of variation of temperature.</i>&mdash;I have already
described an experiment which proves that rise of temperature
induces a movement of closure of the floral leaves of
<i>Nymph&aelig;a</i>, lowering of temperature producing the opposite
effect (p. 311).</p>

<p>From the study of the action of light and of variation
of temperature, it will be seen that the flower of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[Pg 552]</a></span>
<i>Nymph&aelig;a</i> is acted on in the evening by two antagonistic
forces; darkness induces a movement of closure, and
fall of temperature gives rise to a movement of opening.
Since the flower opens in the evening, the predominant
effect is that of falling temperature.</p>

<p>The above conclusions are fully borne out by the
diurnal record which I obtained with <i>Nymph&aelig;a</i>.</p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 640px;">

The lower record exhibits the movement of the flower, up-curve representing
the opening, and down-curve the closure of the flower.</p>
</div>


<p><i>Experiment 209.</i>&mdash;One of the perianth leaves was attached
to one of the recording levers, the differential thermometer
being attached to the other. It will be seen
(Fig. 198) that the movement of the flower follows very
closely the curve of variation of temperature. The flower
was tightly closed in the day time; and the perianth leaves
began to open out in the evening at first slowly, then very
rapidly, and the flower becoming fully expanded by 10 p.m.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[Pg 553]</a></span>
at night. Though the temperature continued to fall, there
was no possibility of further expansion beyond the maximum.
The temperature began to rise after passing through
the minimum at 6 a.m., and the movement of closure
set in with rising temperature, the flower becoming completely
closed by 10 a.m. That geotropism has little
effect is seen from the fact that the inversion of flower
does not interfere with the normal opening or closing of
the flower.</p>

<p>The phenomenon of diurnal movement of <i>Nymph&aelig;a</i> is
therefore thermonastic, the floral leaves exhibiting movement
of opening at night owing to fall of temperature.
<i>Luffa acutangula</i>, which opens in the afternoon, and
closes early in the morning, gives a diurnal record similar
to that of <i>Nymph&aelig;a</i>.</p>


<h4>SUMMARY.</h4>

<p>The flower of <i>Nymph&aelig;a</i> exhibits a movement of closure
during rise of temperature, and of opening during fall
of temperature.</p>

<p>It is shown further that the effects of light and of
rise of temperature are antagonistic to each other. Light
is shown to induce in <i>Nymph&aelig;a</i> the movement of opening,
and darkness to cause the movement of closure.
The diurnal movement of <i>Nymph&aelig;a</i> is not therefore due
to periodic variation of light and darkness, but to the
predominant effect of variation of temperature.</p>

<p>The diurnal record shows that the perianth leaves begin
to open in the evening with falling temperature, and the
flower becomes fully expanded by 10 p.m. The movement
of closure sets in with rising temperature in the
morning, and the flower becomes fully closed by 10 a.m.</p>

THERMO-GEOTROPISM</h2>

<br /><span class="smcap">Sir J. C. Bose</span>,<br />

<br /><i>Assisted by</i><br />

<br /><span class="smcap">Lalit Mohan Mukherji</span>.</h3>


<p>Of the vast number of daily movements perhaps the
largest proportion is due to thermo-geotropic reaction and
its modifications. Thermo-geotropic movements have the
following characteristics:</p>

<p>1. The organs are sensitive to the stimulus of gravity
and the periodic movements are brought about by variation
of geotropic curvature under change of temperature.</p>

<p>2. The movement is not confined to growing organs,
but is also exhibited by organs which are fully grown and
even by rigid trees.</p>

<p>3. The periodic movement is closely related to the
diurnal variation of temperature. Fall of temperature from
thermal-noon (about 2 p.m.) to thermal-dawn (about 6 a.m.)
is attended by a movement of erection; rise of temperature
from thermal-dawn to thermal-noon is followed, on the
other hand, by a reverse movement of fall.</p>

<p>That the movement is primarily due to variation of
temperature will be demonstrated in two different ways:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(<i>a</i>) by the change of normal rhythm of movement by
artificial transpositions of periods of maximum
and minimum temperature, and</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) by the abolition of periodic movement through
maintenance of constant temperature.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[Pg 555]</a></span></p>

<p>That the phenomenon is not nastic, but paratonic will
be demonstrated:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(<i>a</i>) by the reversal of closure into opening movement
and <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>, in consequence of inversion of
the plant upside down, and</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) by the diurnal variation of torsional movement, the
direction of which is dependent on the directive
action of the stimulus of gravity.</p></div>

<p>I shall now describe the diurnal movement of various
geotropically curved plant-organs; the most striking
example of this is furnished by the 'Praying' Palm of
Faridpore, already described. I shall here recapitulate some
of the important features connected with the phenomenon.</p>


<h4>DIURNAL MOVEMENT OF PALM TREES.</h4>

<p>Movements similar to that of the Faridpore Palm
(p. 12) are found in other Palm trees growing at an
inclination from the vertical. I reproduce once more the
diurnal curve given by the Sijberia Palm together with the
curve of daily thermal variation (Fig. 199). It will be
seen that the two curves resemble each other so closely
that the curve of movement of the tree is practically a
replica of the thermographic record. There can therefore
be no doubt of the movement being brought about by
variation of temperature; rise of temperature is attended
by the movement of fall of the tree and <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>. The
record was commenced at noon; the temperature rose till
the maximum was reached at about 3 p.m. and the tree
also reached its lowest position at 3-45 p.m., the lag
being 45 minutes. The temperature fell continuously after
the maximum at 3 p.m., to the minimum at 6 a.m. next
morning. In response to the falling temperature, the tree
exhibited a movement of erection. The temperature rose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[Pg 556]</a></span>
after 6 a.m. and the movement of the tree became reversed
from ascent to descent.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 640px;">

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 199.</span>&mdash;Diurnal record of the Sijberia Palm. Upper curve gives variation
of temperature, and the lower curve the movement of the tree.</p>
</div>


<p>I have already shown: (1) that the diurnal movement
just described is due to physiological reaction, and that the
movement is abolished at the death of the plant; (2) that
light has little or no effect, since the thick bark and bases
of leaves screen the living tissue from the action of light;
(3) that transpiration has practically no effect on the
periodic movement, since such movement takes place in
other plants completely immersed under water; thus
<i>Ipom&#339;a aquatica</i>, a water plant, kept under water,
gave the normal diurnal curve similar to that of the
palm. The modifying effect of transpiration was in this
case, completely excluded. I obtained similar effect with
geotropically curved stem of <i>Basella cordifolia</i> (p. 25);<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[Pg 557]</a></span>
(4) that the weight of the plant-organ as such, has little
effect on the diurnal curve, since an inverted plant continues
for a few days to exhibit the periodic movement, in
spite of the antagonistic effect of weight. A different
experiment will be described (see p. 582) where the effect
of weight was completely neutralised and the plant-organ
gave, nevertheless, the normal diurnal curve.</p>

procumbent stem of <i>Trop&aelig;olum</i> and the dia-geotropic leaf of palm. Note general
similarity between diurnal curve of plants and the thermographic record.</p>
</div>


<p>I have also shown that the diurnal movement is
determined by the modifying influence of temperature on
geotropic curvature. Rise of temperature opposes or
neutralises the geotropic curvature; fall of temperature, on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[Pg 558]</a></span>
the other hand, accentuates it. The particular diurnal movement
was not confined to the palm trees, but was exhibited
by all plant-organs subjected to the stimulus of gravity.</p>

</div>

<h4>DIURNAL MOVEMENT OF PROCUMBENT STEMS AND OF LEAVES.</h4>

<p><i>Experiment 210.</i>&mdash;In order to demonstrate the continuity of
the phenomenon of diurnal movement I took various stems
growing in water or land for my experiment. The plants
were laid horizontally, till the stems bent up and assumed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[Pg 559]</a></span>
the stable position of geotropic equilibrium. In figure 200
is given records of the inclined palm tree, of procumbent
stem of <i>Trop&aelig;olum</i>, and the leaf of the palm tree. The
very close relation between the temperature-variation and the
movement of different plant-organs is sufficiently obvious.</p>

<p>I shall next give a series of diurnal records of leaves
of different plants such as those of <i>Dahlia</i>, <i>Papaya</i> and
<i>Croton</i> (Fig. 201). In these also fall of temperature induces
an up-movement while rise of temperature causes a fall
of the leaf. I shall presently refer to the 'personal
equation' by which the record of one plant is distinguished
from another.</p>


<h4>CONTINUOUS DIURNAL RECORD FOR SUCCESSIVE THERMAL
NOONS.</h4>

<p><i>Experiment 211.</i>&mdash;The diurnal record given above, was
taken from ordinary noon at 12 o'clock to noon next
day. The diurnal curve becomes much simplified if the
record be taken from <i>thermal-noon</i> (at about 2 p.m.) to
the thermal noon next day. The plant-organ becomes
erected during falling temperature from thermal-noon to
thermal-dawn next morning, and undergoes a fall during
rise of temperature from thermal-dawn to thermal-noon.
The subsequent diurnal records will therefore be given for
24 hours commencing with 2 p.m. In figure 202 is given
diurnal records of geotropically curved stem of <i>Trop&aelig;olum</i>
and the leaf of <i>Dahlia</i> for two days in succession.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[Pg 560]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 202.</span>&mdash;Diurnal curve of the procumbent stem of <i>Trop&aelig;olum majus</i>, and
the leaf of <i>Dahlia</i> for two successive days. In the thermographic record the up-curve
represents fall, and down-curve rise of temperature.</p>
</div>


<p>The thermal record shows that there was a continuous
fall of temperature from thermal-noon at 2 p.m. to the
thermal-dawn at 6 a.m. next morning, that is to say, for
16 hours. Rise of temperature through the same range
occurred in 8 hours from 6 a.m. till 2 p.m. The average
rate of rise of temperature was thus twice as quick as
that of fall. This is clearly seen from the slopes of thermal
curve during thermal ascent and descent. The record
of the movement of the plant shows a striking parallelism;
the different plant-organs became erected from thermal-noon
to thermal-dawn, and underwent a fall from thermal-dawn
to thermal-noon. The descent of the curve is, as in the
case of thermal curve, relatively more abrupt. The records
on two successive days are very similar, the slight differ<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[Pg 561]</a></span>ence
being due to the physiological depression consequent
on prolonged maintenance of the plants in a closed chamber.</p>


<h4>MODIFICATION OF THE DIURNAL CURVE.</h4>

<p>I shall now proceed to explain the modifications that
may occur in the standard thermo-geotropic curve.</p>

<p><i>Turning points.</i>&mdash;In the bulky Palm, the reversal of
movement from fall to rise or <i>vice vers&acirc;</i> takes place about
an hour after the thermal inversion. This lag is partly
due to the time taken by a mass of tissue to assume the
temperature of the surrounding air. There is, moreover,
the question of physiological inertia which delays the
reaction. In leaves this lag may be considerably less or even
absent. In certain cases the reversal of movement may
take place a little earlier than the temperature inversion.
It should be remembered in this connection, that in
response to temperature change, the leaf is often displaced
to a considerable extent from its 'mean position of equilibrium';
moreover the force of recovery is greatest at the
two extreme positions. These considerations probably explain
the quick return of the leaf to equilibrium position. The
slow autonomous movement of the leaf may sometimes
prove to be a contributory factor.</p>

<p><i>Effect of irregular fluctuation of temperature.</i>&mdash;In settled
weather the diurnal rise and fall of temperature is very
regular. But under less settled condition, owing to the
change of direction of the wind, the temperature curve shows
one or more fluctuations, specially in the forenoon. It was a
matter of surprise to me to find the plant-record repeating
the fluctuations of thermal record with astonishing fidelity.
This common twitch in the two records is seen in the
record of the Sijberia Palm (Fig. 199). Certain plants are
extremely sensitive to variation of temperature; so
much so that these physiological indicators of thermal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[Pg 562]</a></span>
variation are far more delicate than ordinary thermometers.</p>

<p><i>Effect of restricted pliability of the organ.</i>&mdash;A leaf is
more pliable in one direction than in the other. The
pulvinus of <i>Mimosa</i>, for example, allows a greater amount
of bending downwards than upwards; in consequence of
this the leaf in its fall becomes almost parallel to the
internode below; the up-movement is, however, far more
restricted. The leaf in its most erect position still makes
a considerable angle with the internode of the stem above
it. If the leaf-stalk of a plant be restricted in its rise
the erectile movement at night will reach a limit, and
the top of the curve will remain flat. This is seen,
illustrated in the record of the leaf of <i>Croton</i> (Fig. 202),
which attains its maximum erection at 9 p.m. and the
subsequent curve remains flattened till 7 a.m.; after this
the leaf begins to execute its downward movement. In
other cases, the range of up-movement is very great
and the plant-organ erects itself continuously till morning.
In certain cases the impulse of up-movement carries
the organ beyond the stable position of equilibrium;
after this the leaf begins to retrace its path slowly; the
down-movement due to rise of temperature is, however, far
more abrupt, and easily distinguishable from the previous
slow return.</p>

<p>It will thus be seen that though the diurnal record
consists of an alternating up and down curve, yet these
minor characteristics or 'personal equation' of the plant
confers on the record a certain stamp of individuality.</p>

<p><i>Effect of age.</i>&mdash;In the floral leaves of <i>Nymph&aelig;a</i> the
thermonastic movement is of positive sign; that is to say,
an erection of the petal during rise, and a fall during the
lowering of temperature. The corresponding movement of
leaves would therefore be an erection of the leaf in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[Pg 563]</a></span>
day-time, and a fall of the leaf at night. The periodic
curve of such leaves would be of opposite sign to the standard
thermo-geotropic curves given above. The leaf of
<i>Nicotina</i> is adduced as an example of a leaf which exhibits
a movement of fall at night. But the fully grown and
horizontally spread leaf I find that gives the normal record.
The very young growing leaves give a different and somewhat
erratic curve. The difference between growing and
fully grown leaves is explained by the fact that the former
would be affected by thermotropism, and the latter by
thermo-geotropism. Young leaves exhibit moreover a pronounced
hyponasty or epinasty, which would naturally
modify the diurnal curve.</p>

<p>Certain interesting variation is met with in the diurnal
record of sprouting leaves of <i>Mimosa</i> in spring. The movements
of leaves grown later in the season, as will be explained
in a later chapter, are very definite and characteristic.
But the young leaves in spring exhibit no definite
diurnal curve, but a series of automatic pulsations, the unsuspected
presence of which in all leaves of <i>Mimosa</i> will
be demonstrated in a subsequent chapter. Later in the
season, the leaf becomes tuned, as it were, to the periodic
variation of the environment; the automatic movements
become suppressed, and the diurnal periodicity becomes
deeply impressed on the organism.</p>

<p><i>Effect of season.</i>&mdash;The diurnal curve may also be modified
by the seasonal variation of any one of the effective
factors. <i>Trop&aelig;olum majus</i>, for example, exhibits positive
phototropic action in one season and a negative reaction
in a different season. These seasonal variations must
necessarily modify the diurnal curve.</p>

<p>I shall now proceed to demonstrate the determining
influence of thermal variation, and of stimulus of gravity on
the thermo-geotropic movements. The striking similarity of
the thermograph, and the record of movement of plants<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">[Pg 564]</a></span>
demonstrate the causal relation between temperature variation
and diurnal movement, of which the two additional
tests described below offer further confirmation.</p>


<h4>REVERSAL OF NORMAL RHYTHM.</h4>

<p>The normal diurnal movement is, as we have seen, a
fall during rise of temperature from morning to afternoon,
and a rise from afternoon till next morning. I succeeded
in reversing the normal rhythm of <i>Basella</i> by reversing
the normal variation of temperature at the two turning
points, in the morning and in the afternoon. The plant
was subjected to falling temperature in the morning and to
rising temperature in the afternoon. The normal movement
now became reversed, <i>i.e.</i>, an erection instead of fall in the
forenoon and a fall instead of rise in the afternoon (p. 28).</p>


<h4>EFFECT OF CONSTANT TEMPERATURE.</h4>

<p>The second test which I shall employ is the effect of
maintenance of constant temperature, which should wipe off,
as it were, traces of periodic movement. It was necessary
for this investigation to maintain the plant chamber at
constant temperature throughout day and night. The usual
thermostat is virtually a recess in a double-walled
chamber filled with water, the chamber being covered
with a heat insulating material. But this contrivance is
unsuitable for the plant chamber which is to contain
good sized plants, and the recording apparatus. The
problem of maintaining a large air-chamber at constant
temperature presented many difficulties which were ultimately
overcome by the device of an extremely sensitive
thermal regulator.</p>

<p><i>The Thermal Regulator.</i>&mdash;I shall in a future paper give
a complete account of the large thermostatic air-chamber.
The important part of the apparatus is an electro-thermic
regulator which interrupts the heating electric current as
soon as the temperature of the chamber is raised a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[Pg 565]</a></span>
hundredth part of a degree above the predetermined temperature.
The automatic make and break of the current
takes place in rapid succession, and the temperature of
the chamber is thus maintained constant within tenth of
a degree, throughout day and night.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 640px;">

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 203.</span>&mdash;Abolition of diurnal movement in <i>Trop&aelig;olum</i> under constant
temperature, and its restoration under normal daily fluctuation. The upper
record is of temperature and the lower of plant movement.</p>
</div>


<p><i>Diurnal record of</i> Trop&aelig;olum <i>under constant temperature:
Experiment 212.</i>&mdash;The normal record of geotropically
curved <i>Trop&aelig;olum</i> is already given in figure 202. In repeating
the record I maintained the plant at constant temperature
for 24 hours; the result of this is seen in the
first part of the record (Fig. 203). The thermal record
is practically horizontal, and the diurnal record of the plant
shows no periodic movement. The thermal regulator was on
the next day put out of operation, thus restoring the normal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[Pg 566]</a></span>
diurnal variation of temperature. The record of the plant
is seen to exhibit once more its normal periodic movement.</p>

<p>I have in the chapter on thermo-geotropism (p. 515) shown
that the diurnal movement of a geotropically curved
organ is determined in reference to the direction of force
of gravity. This will be seen demonstrated in an interesting
manner in the two following experiments on the
effect of inversion of the plant on daily movement.</p>


<h4>DIURNAL MOVEMENT IN INVERTED POSITION.</h4>

<p>I have already referred to the distinction that is made
between nastic and paratonic movements. In the former
the movement is autonomous and in relation to the plant,
and in the latter it is due to an external force which
determines the direction of movement. In nastic reaction,
closure movement would persist as a closure movement<a name="FNanchor_A_42" id="FNanchor_A_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_42" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>;
but should the direction of movement be determined by
the stimulus of gravity, closure movement would, on inversion,
be reversed into an opening movement. Viewed from
an external point of view an up-movement in the latter
case would, after readjustment on inversion, become an up-movement,
though in so doing, the expansion should be
transferred from the upper to the lower side of the organ.
It is to be understood in this connection, that some time
must lapse before this readjustment is possible, and that
the former movement may continue, in certain cases, as
a persistence of after-effect.</p>

<p>I succeeded in demonstrating the paratonic effect of
geotropic stimulus on the periodic movement of the palm
leaf, by holding the plant in an inverted position (p. 24).
On the first day of inversion, the diurnal record was
erratic, but in the course of 24 hours, the leaf readjusted
itself to its unaccustomed position, and became somewhat
erected under geotropic action. After the attainment of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[Pg 567]</a></span>
this new state of geotropic equilibrium, the leaf gave the
record of down-movement during rise, and up-movement
during fall of temperature, movements which in reference
to the plant are the very opposite to those in a normal
position. But seen from an external point of view, rise
of temperature caused in both normal and inverted
positions, a down-movement indicative of diminished
geotropic curvature; fall of temperature, on the other hand,
brought about an erectile movement, thus exhibiting
enhancement of geotropic curvature.</p>

the plant in the normal position.</p>


<h4>SUMMARY.</h4>

<p>A continuity is shown to exist between the thermo-geotropic
response of rigid trees, stems, and leaves of
plants.</p>

<p>The diurnal record exhibits an erectile movement from
thermal-noon to thermal-dawn, and a movement of fall
from thermal-dawn to thermal-noon.</p>

<p>In contrast with thermonastic movement which takes
place in growing organs, thermo-geotropic movement
takes place in fully grown organs including rigid trees.
The thermonastic movement is independent of the direction
of gravity, while in thermo-geotropic reaction, the stimulus
of gravity exerts a directive action.</p>

<p>The effect of variation of temperature on the diurnal
movement is demonstrated by induced change of normal
rhythm, by artificial transposition of periods of thermal
inversion, and by the abolition of periodic movement
under constant temperature.</p>

<p>The effect of stimulus of gravity on the diurnal movement
is demonstrated by the effect induced on holding
the plant upside down. The direction of the daily movement
is found to be determined by the directive action
of the stimulus of gravity.</p>

<h2><a name="L_THE_AFTER-EFFECT_OF_LIGHT" id="L_THE_AFTER-EFFECT_OF_LIGHT"></a>L.&mdash;THE AFTER-EFFECT OF LIGHT</h2>

<h3><i>By</i><br />

<br /><span class="smcap">Sir J. C. Bose</span>,<br />

<br /><i>Assisted by</i><br />

<br /><span class="smcap">Surendra Chandra Das</span>.</h3>


<p>We have considered two types of diurnal movement,
one due to the predominant action of variation of light,
and the other, to that of changing temperature. There
are, however, other organs which are sensitive to variations
both of light and of temperature. The effect of light is,
generally speaking, antagonistic to that of rise of temperature;
hence the resultant of the two becomes highly
complex.</p>

<p>Still greater complexity is introduced by the different
factors of immediate and after-effect of light. This latter
phenomenon is very obscure, and I attempted to determine
its characteristics by electrical method of investigation. A
fuller account of after-effect of light on the response of
various plant-organs and of animal retin&aelig; will be found
elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_A_43" id="FNanchor_A_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_43" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> I shall here refer only to one or two
characteristic results which have immediate bearing on
the present subject.</p>

<p>Direct stimulation under light induces excitatory reaction,
which is mechanically exhibited by contraction, and
electrically by induced galvanometric negativity. Under
continuous stimulation, the excitatory effect, either of positive
curvature or of induced galvanometric negativity, is
found to attain a maximum. This is often found to
undergo a decline and reversal; for under continuous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[Pg 570]</a></span>
stimulation there is a fatigue-decline, as seen in the
relaxation following normal contraction in animal muscle.
The positive tropic curvature, and the induced galvanometric
negativity may thus undergo a decline, and neutralisation.
This neutralisation is also favoured, in certain
cases, by transverse conduction of excitation to the distal
side.</p>

<p>The character of the after-effect will presently be
shown to be modified by the duration of previous stimulation,
the different phases of which will for convenience,
be distinguished as pre-maximum, maximum and
post-maximum. Since stimulus simultaneously induces
positive "A" and the negative "D" changes (p. 143),
their intensities will undergo relative variation during the
continuance and cessation of stimulus. The after-effect
will therefore exhibit unequal persistence of the expansive
"A" and contractile "D" reaction at different phases of
stimulation.</p>


<h4>ELECTRIC AFTER-EFFECT.</h4>

<p>Confining our attention to the electric response, it is
found that under continued action of light the excitatory
galvanometric negativity increases to a maximum, after
which there is a decline, and neutralisation. Figure 205
gives the galvanographic record of the electric response of
the leaf stalk of <i>Bryophyllum</i> under light; the up-curve
represents increasing negativity which, after attaining a
maximum, undergoes neutralisation as seen in the down-curve.
I shall, with the help of the diagram given in
the next figure, describe and explain the various after-effects
I observed on sudden stoppage of light: before the
attainment of maximum, at the maximum, and after the
maximum.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 206.</span>&mdash;Diagrammatic representation of electric after-effect of stimulation.
Pre-maximal stimulation produced by stoppage of light at <i>a</i>, gives rise to continuation
of previous response followed by recovery. Stoppage of light at maximum <i>b</i>
gives rise to recovery to equilibrium position. Stoppage of light at post-maximum
<i>c</i>, gives rise to over-shooting below zero line.</p>
</div>


<p><i>After-effect of pre-maximum stimulation: Experiment
214.</i>&mdash;Light is applied at arrow and stopped in different
experiments at <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, and <i>c</i> (Fig. 106). Continuous stimulation
induces increasing galvanometric negativity; when
stimulus is stopped at <i>a</i> before the maximum, the after-effect
is a persistence of excitatory galvanometric negativity,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">[Pg 572]</a></span>
which carries the response record higher up; after a
certain interval recovery takes place and the record returns
to the zero line of normal equilibrium. The after-effect of
pre-maximum stimulation is thus a short-lived continuance
of response followed by recovery.</p>

<p><i>After-effect at maximum: Experiment 215.</i>&mdash;In this the
photic stimulus was continued till the attainment of
maximum, when light was suddenly removed at <i>b</i>. The
after-effect was no longer a persistence of responsive
movement, but disappearance of negativity and recovery
to zero line of equilibrium.</p>

<p><i>Post-maximum after-effect: Experiment 216.</i>&mdash;In this
light was continued till there was a complete neutralisation,
the curve of response returning to zero line; to all outer
seeming the responsive indication of the tissue is the
same as before excitation. But stoppage of stimulus at <i>c</i>
causes an over-shooting at a rapid rate far <i>below</i> the zero
line; and it is after a considerable period that the curve
returns to the zero line of equilibrium.</p>

<p>The condition at post-maximum <i>c</i> is thus one of dynamic
equilibrium where two opposite activities, "A" and "D,"
balance each other; for had the condition of the 'neutralised'
tissue been exactly the same when fresh, cessation
of stimulus would have kept the galvanometric spot of
light at the zero position.</p>

<p>The electric investigation described above shows that
the after-effect is modified by duration of stimulation, and
that:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(1) the after-effect of pre-maximum stimulation is
the continuation of response in the original
direction (upward, and away from zero line),
followed by recovery,</p>

<p>(2) the after-effect of the maximum is an electric
recovery towards zero position, and</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">[Pg 573]</a></span></p>
<p>(3) the after-effect of post-maximum stimulation is
an over-shooting <i>downward</i> below the zero line.</p></div>


<h4>TROPIC RESPONSE UNDER LIGHT AND ITS AFTER-EFFECT.</h4>

<p>I shall now describe the after-effect of light as seen in
mechanical response, and the results will be found parallel
to those given by the electric response. The specimen
employed is the terminal leaflet of <i>Desmodium gyrans</i>,
the pulvinus of which is very sensitive to light. Pulvinated
organs, generally speaking, exhibit a diurnal variation
of turgor in consequence of which the position of
equilibrium of the leaf or leaflet undergoes a periodic
change. But this equilibrium position of the organ
remains fairly constant for nearly two hours about midday,
the variation of temperature at this period being
slight. We may therefore obtain the pure effect of light
by carrying out the experiment at this period, and
completing it within a short time to avoid complication
arising from the autonomous variation of turgor.</p>

<p>The period of experiment of the plant may be shortened
by a choice of suitable intensity of light; a given
tropic effect induced by prolonged feeble light may thus
be obtained by short exposure to stronger light. The
source of light for the following experiment was a 50 c.p.
incandescent lamp. The intensity was increased to a suitable
value by focussing light on the upper half of the pulvinus
by means of a lens. The intensity was so adjusted that
the maximum positive curvature was attained in the course
of about 6 minutes, and complete neutralisation after an
exposure of 17 minutes.</p>

<p><i>Pre-maximum after-effect: Experiment 217.</i>&mdash;Light was
allowed to act on the upper half of the pulvinus for two
minutes and twenty seconds; this induced an up-movement<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[Pg 574]</a></span>
<i>i.e.</i>, a positive curvature. On the stoppage of light the up-movement
continued for one minute and twenty seconds,
after which the down-movement of recovery was completed
in six minutes and twenty seconds (Fig. 207). The immediate
after-effect is thus a movement upward, away from the
zero line of equilibrium. The result is seen to be the same
as the electric after-effect of pre-maximum stimulation.</p>

<p><i>After-effect at maximum: Experiment 218.</i>&mdash;Application
of light for 5 minutes and twenty seconds induced a

minutes (Fig. 208).</p>

<p><i>After-effect at post-maximum: Experiment 219.</i>&mdash;As the

was taken and light was applied continuously on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">[Pg 575]</a></span>
upper half of the pulvinus. This gave rise first to a
maximum positive curvature, subsequently diminished by
transverse transmission of excitation. Neutralisation took
place after application of light for 17 minutes. On the
stoppage of light, there was a sudden overshooting <i>below</i>
the zero line (Fig. 209), and the rate of the movement on
the cessation of light was nearly twice as quick as during
the process of neutralisation.</p>


<h4>SUMMARY.</h4>

<p>The after-effect of light is modified by the duration of
exposure to light.</p>

<p>Under continued action of light, the electric response of
galvanometric negativity in plants attains a maximum after
which it undergoes decline, and neutralisation.</p>

<p>The electrical after-effect exhibits characteristic differences
depending on the duration of previous exposure to
light.</p>

<p>The pre-maximal after-effect is a temporary continuation
of response under light followed by recovery.</p>

<p>The after-effect at the maximum is a recovery to the
normal equilibrium.</p>

<p>The after-effect at post-maximum is an 'overshooting'
below the position of equilibrium.</p>

<p>The immediate and after-tropic response of light are
similar to the corresponding photo-electric effects.</p>

<p>The pre-maximum after-effect is a continuation of
positive tropic movement followed by recovery; the after-effect
at maximum is a recovery to the normal equilibrium
position of the organ. The post-maximum after-effect is an
overshooting below the position of normal equilibrium.</p>

<h2><a name="LI_THE_DIURNAL_MOVEMENT_OF_THE_LEAF_OF" id="LI_THE_DIURNAL_MOVEMENT_OF_THE_LEAF_OF"></a>LI.&mdash;THE DIURNAL MOVEMENT OF THE LEAF OF<br />
<i>MIMOSA</i></h2>

<h3><i>By</i><br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Sir J. C. Bose</span>.</h3>


<p>In the standard curve of nyctitropic movement under
thermo-geotropism described in a previous paper, the diurnal
record consisted of an up-curve from thermal-noon to
thermal-dawn, and a down-curve from the thermal-dawn to
thermal-noon. The responding organ, which may be an
inclined stem or a horizontally spread petiole, underwent an
erection during the decline of temperature, and a fall with
the rise of temperature. The diurnal record of the <i>Mimosa</i>
leaf appears, however, to be totally different.</p>

<p><i>Experiment 220.</i>&mdash;I obtained the diurnal record of
<i>Mimosa</i> (Fig. 210) for twenty-four hours commencing at
2 p.m. which is the thermal-noon. The summer and winter
records are essentially the same; the only difference is in
the greater vigour of movement exhibited by summer
specimens. The diurnal movement of the leaf is very
definite and characteristic; for the curves taken five years<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577">[Pg 577]</a></span>
ago do not differ in any way from those obtained this year.
The record may conveniently be divided into four phases.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 640px;">
<img src="images/fig-210.jpg" width="500" height="760" alt="Fig. 210." title="" /><br />
<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 210.</span>&mdash;Diurnal record of <i>Mimosa</i> in summer, and in winter. Leaf rises
from 2 to 5 p.m., when there is a spasmodic fall. Leaf re-erects itself from 9 p.m.
to 6 a.m. after which there is a gradual fall till 2 p.m. with pulsations. The
upper-most record gives temperature variation, up-curve representing fall of
temperature and <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>.</p>
</div>


<p><i>First phase.</i>&mdash;The leaf erects itself after the thermal-noon
up to 5 or 5-30 p.m. The temperature, it should be
remembered, is undergoing a fall during this period.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[Pg 578]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Second phase.</i>&mdash;There is a sudden fall of the leaf in the
evening which continues till 9 p.m. or thereabout.</p>

<p><i>Third phase.</i>&mdash;The leaf erects itself till thermal-dawn
at about 6 a.m. next morning.</p>

<p><i>Fourth phase.</i>&mdash;There is a fall of the leaf during the
rise of temperature from thermal-dawn to thermal-noon.
The uniformity of the fall is, however, interrupted by one
or more pulsations in the forenoon. These pulsations are
more frequent in summer than in winter.</p>

<p>It will thus be seen that the difference between the
normal thermo-geotropic curve, and the curve of <i>Mimosa</i> is
not so great as appears at first sight. With the exception
of the spasmodic fall in the evening, the diurnal curve shows
an erectile movement during lowering of temperature, and
a movement of fall during rise of temperature. I shall
presently explain the reason of the sudden fall in the evening,
and of the multiple pulsations in the forenoon.</p>

<p>I have, moreover, been able to trace a continuity in
<i>Mimosa</i> itself, between the standard thermo-geotropic
reactions and the modification of it by the action of light.
The young leaves which sprout out at the beginning of
spring take some time to become adjusted to the diurnal
variation. There are two intermediate stages through which
the leaves pass before they exhibit their characteristic
diurnal curve. Slow rhythmic pulsations are at first seen
to occur during day and night. At the next stage the
leaves exhibit the diurnal movement of fall from thermal-dawn
to thermal-noon, and movement of erection from
thermal-noon to thermal-dawn next morning, the record
being in every way similar to the standard thermo-geotropic
curve. It is only at the final stage that there is a spasmodic
fall in the evening which we shall find is the characteristic
after-effect of light.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">[Pg 579]</a></span></p>

<p>Before proceeding further I shall refer briefly to the
theory of Millardet in explanation of the diurnal movement
of the leaf of <i>Mimosa</i>. He found that the tension in stems,
and presumably its turgor, is increased with rise and decreased
with fall of temperature. The movement of the
lateral leaf may, therefore, be due to the induced variation
of tension in the main axis. Had this been the case the
minimum tension would have occurred at the minimum
temperature in the morning, and the leaf should have undergone
a maximum fall. The maximum temperature attained
in the afternoon should have, on the other hand, brought
about the maximum erection. The observed facts are, however,
the very opposite to these. Kraus and Millardet also
found that light and darkness had great influence on the
tension, which increases in darkness and diminishes in light.
The tension at dawn may therefore be a resultant of the
depressing effect of low temperature opposed by the promoting
effect of darkness, the latter being the predominant
factor. The erect position of <i>Mimosa</i> leaf in the morning
may thus be accounted for by the resultant increase of
tension of the stem. The explanation of the movements of
the leaves is thus to be attributed to the variation of tension
in the main axis to which the leaves are attached;
this leads to the conclusion that the leaf movement should
be determined in relation to the plant, and not in relation
to the external stimulus. I shall, however, describe
a crucial experiment in the course of this paper, which
will show that the direction of stimulus of gravity has a
determining influence on the periodic movement. The
sudden fall of the leaf before evening is again inexplicable
from the theory of periodic variation of tension.</p>

<p>The complexity in the diurnal movement in <i>Mimosa</i>
arises from the fact that there are three factors whose fluctuating
effects are different at different parts of the day.
The effect at any particular hour results from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">[Pg 580]</a></span>
algebraical summation of the following factors: (1) the
thermo-geotropic action, (2) the immediate effect of photic
stimulus and (3) the after-effect of light. The leaf of
<i>Mimosa</i> has, moreover, as I shall show, an autonomous
movement of its own. I shall take up the full consideration
of the subject in the following order:</p>

<p>1. <i>The thermo-geotropic reaction.</i>&mdash;A crucial experiment
will be described which demonstrates the effect of thermo-geotropism
in the diurnal movement of the leaf of
<i>Mimosa</i>.</p>

<p>2. <i>Autonomous pulsation of</i> Mimosa.&mdash;The natural
pulsation of the plant is obscured by the paratonic effect
of external stimuli. I shall explain the method by which
the natural pulsation of the leaf becomes fully revealed.</p>

<p>3. <i>The immediate effect of light.</i>&mdash;This is not constant,
but will be shown to undergo a definite variation
with the intensity and duration of light. A very great
difficulty in the study of effect of daylight at different
parts of the day is introduced on account of the absence
of any reliable recorder for measurement of fluctuation
of light. I shall describe a device which gives a continuous
record of photic variation for the whole day.</p>

<p>4. <i>The after-effect of light.</i>&mdash;The spasmodic fall of
the leaf of <i>Mimosa</i> towards the evening presents the
most difficult problem for solution. I shall first describe
the diurnal movement of another plant which presents
characteristics similar to those of <i>Mimosa</i>. I shall also
demonstrate the various after-effects of light at different
parts of the day. These results will offer the fullest
explanation of the sudden fall of the leaf towards
evening.</p>

<p>As regards the sudden fall of the leaf about evening,
Pfeffer regarded it as due to increased mechanical
moment of the secondary petioles moving forward on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">[Pg 581]</a></span>
the withdrawal of light. I shall, however, in the course of
this paper show, that the characteristic movements occur
even after complete removal of the sub-petioles. In the
following experiment, carried out with the intact plant,
the effect of possible variation of weight is completely
eliminated. In spite of this, the diurnal movement exhibited
its characteristic phases including sudden movement
in the evening.</p>

<p>The experiment I am going to describe will exhibit
the diurnal curve obtained by an entirely different
method, and will clearly exhibit the thermo-geotropic
effect, as well as the immediate and after-effect of light.</p>


<h4>DIURNAL VARIATION OF GEOTROPIC TORSION.</h4>

<p>I have shown that the pulvinus of <i>Mimosa</i>, subjected
laterally to the action of stimulus of gravity, exhibits
a torsional response. When the <i>Mimosa</i> plant is laid
sideways, so that the plane of separation of the upper
and lower halves of the pulvinus is vertical, geotropic
stimulus acts laterally on the two halves of the differentially
excitable pulvinus. When the less excitable upper
half is to the left of the observer (see Fig. 179), the
responsive torsion under geotropic stimulus will be clock-wise,
the less excitable upper half of the pulvinus being thereby
made to face the vertical lines of gravity. When the plant
is turned over to the other side (the less excitable upper
half being now to the right of the observer) the induced
torsion will be counter clock-wise. The response is therefore
determined by the directive action of stimulus of
gravity. Light has also been shown to give rise to
torsion (p. 400). Light acting in the same direction
as the stimulus of gravity, <i>i.e.</i>, from above, enhances the
rate of torsion, the curve of response being due to the
joint effects of light and gravity.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">[Pg 582]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 640px;">

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 211.</span>&mdash;Record of diurnal variation of torsion in <i>Mimosa</i> leaf. Up-curve
represents increase and down-curve decrease of geotropic torsion.</p>
</div>


<p><i>Experiment 221.</i>&mdash;I obtained 24 hours' record of variation
of torsional response of <i>Mimosa</i>, commencing with
thermal-noon at 2 p.m. It is to be borne in mind that
increase of torsion indicates increase of geotropic action,
just as the erectile movement of the leaf in the normal
position indicates the enhanced geotropic effect. Inspection
of figure 211 shows that the fall of temperature after
thermal-noon was attended by increase of torsion. The
curve went up till about 5 p.m., as in the ordinary
record of <i>Mimosa</i>. The torsion suddenly decreased with the
rapid diminution of light after 5 p.m. The torsion then
increased with falling temperature from 9 p.m. till
thermal-dawn next morning. After 6 a.m. there is a
continuous diminution of torsion till 5 p.m.</p>

<p>We may now summarise the diurnal variation of
torsion exhibited by <i>Mimosa</i>. The torsion undergoes a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">[Pg 583]</a></span>
periodic increase during the fall of temperature from
afternoon till next morning, and a diminution during
rising temperature from morning till afternoon. A sudden
diminution of torsion occurs at about 5 p.m. due to the
disappearance of light. The torsional record is, to all
intents and purposes, a replica of the record of periodic
up and down movements of the leaf.</p>

<p>This method of torsion has several advantages over the
ordinary method. First, the petiole being supported by
the loop of wire, the weight of the leaf has no effect on
the curve of response. In the second place, the periodic
variation of turgor of the stem, as suggested by Millardet,
will not in any way affect the record. Variation of
turgor can only cause a swing to and fro, in a direction
perpendicular to the plane which divides the pulvinus
into upper and lower halves; it can in no way induce
a torsional movement, or a variation of the rate of that
movement.</p>

<p><i>The automatic pulsation of the leaf of</i> Mimosa.&mdash;The
occurrence of the pulsatory response in the morning record
of <i>Mimosa</i> led me to search for multiple activity in
the response of the pulvinus. I have in my previous
investigation on the electric response of <i>Mimosa</i> obtained
multiple series of responses to a single strong stimulus.
Blackman and Paine have recently shown that an isolated
pulvinus of <i>Mimosa</i> exhibit multiple mechanical twitches
under excitation.<a name="FNanchor_A_44" id="FNanchor_A_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_44" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>Even under normal conditions, the sprouting young
leaves in March, as already stated, exhibit automatic
pulsations throughout the day and night; in older leaves
tuned to diurnal periodic movements, these natural pulsations
are more or less suppressed. But in the forenoon,
several pulsations are exhibited even by the old leaves.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">[Pg 584]</a></span></p>

<p>The question may now be asked: Why should the
pulsations occur preferably in the morning? In connection
with this I shall refer to the suppression of the
pulsatory activity of <i>Desmodium gyrans</i> when the leaflet
was pulled up by the action of light (cf. Fig. 188).
The leaf of <i>Mimosa</i> executes a very rapid movement of
erection at night, and the natural pulsations are thereby
rendered very inconspicuous. These pulsations may, however,
be found in the night record of young leaves.
The general occurrence of pulsations in the forenoon is
probably due to the fact that the resultant force which
causes the down-movement is at the time relatively feeble&mdash;the
operative factors being: (1) the action of the rising
temperature which induces down-movement, and (2) the
action of light which in the forenoon opposes this movement.
It will thus be seen that the forces in operation
in the forenoon are more or less in a state of balance,
hence conditions for exhibition of natural pulsations are
more favourable in the morning than in other parts of
the day.</p>

<p><i>Experiment 222.</i>&mdash;I next tried to discover conditions
under which the plant would exhibit its normal rhythmic
activity during the whole course of 24 hours. The external
stimuli which may interfere with the exhibition
of its automatic pulsations are those due to gravity
and light. They act most effectively on the pulvinus,
when that organ is more or less horizontal and therefore
at right angles to the direction of the incident stimulus;
they act least effectively on the pulvinus when the organ
is parallel to the direction of the external force. This
latter condition may be secured by holding the plant upside
down, when the pulvinus bends up and the leaf becomes
erect and almost parallel to the vertical lines of gravity and
to vertical light from above. The leaf, now relatively free
from the effects of external stimulus, was found to exhibit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">[Pg 585]</a></span>
its autonomous pulsations for more than seven days. I
reproduce two sets of records (Fig. 212) for 24 hours each,
obtained on the first and the third day. The average period
of a single pulsation is slightly less than six hours; but
this is likely to be modified by the age of the specimen
and the temperature of the environment.</p>

</div>

<p>One of the factors that determines the diurnal movement
of the leaf is the immediate and after-effect of light. The
movement under the action of light, is modified by
the intensity and duration of illumination. The experimental
investigation of the subject offers many difficulties,
principally owing to the absence of any reliable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">[Pg 586]</a></span>
indicator for the varying intensity of light during the
course of the day.</p>

</div>

<h4>THE PHOTOMETRIC RECORDER.</h4>


<p>This difficulty I have been able to overcome by the
automatic device for continuous record of the variation
of light. The electric resistance of a selenium cell undergoes
diminution with the intensity of light that falls on
it. The photo-sensitive cell was made the fourth arm of a
Wheatstone bridge, the resistance of the cell being exactly
balanced when the shutter of the sensitive cell was closed.
The selenium receiver was pointed upwards against the
sky. Precaution was taken that it was protected from the
direct action of sunlight. On opening the shutter a deflection
of the index of a sensitive galvanometer was produced,
and the deflection increased with increasing intensity of
diffuse skylight. The special difficulty was in securing
automatic record of the galvanometer deflections. This<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587">[Pg 587]</a></span>
was obtained by a special contrivance of an oscillating
smoked glass plate, the up and down oscillation being
at intervals of 30 minutes. A detailed account of this
apparatus will, with its possibilities for meteorology, be
given in a future paper. I reproduce the record obtained
in my greenhouse on the 5th March (1919), which gives a
general idea of the variation of the light from morning to
evening (Fig. 213). The record shows that the light began
to be perceptible at 5-30 a.m., and that the intensity
increased rapidly and continuously till it reached a climax
at noon, after which it began to decline slowly. The
decline of intensity of light was very abrupt after 5 p.m.,
the effect being reduced to zero at 6-30 p.m.</p>


<h4>THE EFFECT OF DIRECT LIGHT.</h4>

<p>Under natural conditions, the leaf of <i>Mimosa</i> is acted
on by light from above, and it is generally supposed that
the pulvinus is positively phototropic, that is to say, it
curves upwards till the leaf is placed at right angles to
the direction of light. My investigations show, however,
that the phototropic effects vary from positive to negative
through an intermediate stage of neutralisation, these depending
on the intensity and duration of exposure. When
light acts continuously on the upper half of the pulvinus,
there follows the following sequences of reaction:</p>

<p>(1) The leaf is at first erected by the contraction of
the upper half of the pulvinus due to direct action of
light acting from above.</p>

<p>(2) Under continuous stimulation of the upper half of the
pulvinus by light, the excitation is slowly conducted to the
lower half across the pulvinus. In consequence of this
transmitted excitation, the lower half begins to contract
and thus neutralises the first effect of erection. The upper
half of the pulvinus is less contractile than the lower<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">[Pg 588]</a></span>
half, and the neutralisation is due to the full contraction
of the upper half antagonised by slight contraction of the
lower half. The horizontal position of the leaf under light
is therefore the result of balance of the two antagonistic
reactions. If the incident light be very strong, the more
intense transmitted excitation induces greater contraction of
the lower half, and bring about a resultant down-movement
(<i>cf.</i> p. 331).</p>

<p>Let us consider the effect of daily variation of light on
<i>Mimosa</i>; we have here to take account both of intensity
and duration. The intensity of light is seen to undergo a
continuous increase which reaches a climax at noon; it
then begins to decline slowly and the diminution of intensity
of light is very abrupt after 5 p.m.</p>

<p>Under natural conditions the following phototropic effects
are observed during the course of the day: light acting
from above induces an up-movement of the leaf; but
this is opposed by the thermo-geotropic fall of the leaf due
to rise of temperature. As the two opposing effects are nearly
balanced, any fluctuation of the relative intensity of the
two gives rise to the pulsatory movements often seen in
the forenoon; the <i>Mimosa</i> leaf has moreover an autonomous
movement of its own. Under continued action of light
neutralisation begins to take place after 1 p.m. (<i>cf.</i>
<i>Expt.</i> 135). Later in the day the phototropic effect may
become negative; reversal into this negative takes place
under the joint action of intensity and duration of light;
it takes place earlier under strong, and later under feeble,
light.</p>


<h4>THE EVENING SPASMODIC FALL OF THE LEAF.</h4>

<p>I shall now deal with the difficult problem of the sudden
fall of the leaf after 5 p.m. Pfeffer regarded this sudden
fall in the evening as due to the increased mechanical
moment of the secondary petioles moving forward on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589">[Pg 589]</a></span>
withdrawal of light. But the following experiment shows
that the increased mechanical moment cannot be the true
explanation of the fall.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 420px;">
<img src="images/fig-214.jpg" width="301" height="448" alt="Fig. 214." title="" /><br />
<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 214.</span>&mdash;Record of leaf of <i>Mimosa</i>
after amputation of sub-petioles. The leaf
fell up to 2-30 p.m., and rose till 5 p.m.,
after which there is a spasmodic fall.
(Successive dots at intervals of 15
minutes.)</p>
</div>

<p><i>Diurnal movement of the amputated petiole: Experiment
223.</i>&mdash;In my present experiment the possibility of variation
of mechanical movement was obviated by cutting off the
end of the petiole, which carried the sub-petioles. The cut
end was coated with collodion flexile to prevent evaporation.
The intense stimulus caused by amputation induced
the excitatory fall of the leaf, but it recovered its normal
activity after a period of
three hours or so. The
diurnal record of the leaf
was commenced shortly
after 1 p.m.; it will be
noticed that the leaf, though
deprived of the weight of
its sub-petioles, still exhibited
a sudden fall at about
5 p.m. (Fig. 214). The fall
of the leaf cannot therefore
be due to increased mechanical
moment. The effect
of weight was, moreover,
eliminated in torsional response
(<i>Expt.</i> 221). In spite
of this the leaf exhibited
a sudden movement after
5 p.m.</p>

<p>Pfeffer has in his 'Entstehung der Schlafbewegung'
(1907) offered another explanation of the sudden fall of the
leaf of <i>Mimosa</i>. This, according to him, is not the direct
effect of diminished intensity of light in the evening, but
is due to the release of the leaf from the phototropic action
of light, which, so long as it is sufficiently intense, holds the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_590" id="Page_590">[Pg 590]</a></span>
leaf in the normal position with its upper surface at right
angles to the incident rays. Thus, on being set free from
the strong action of light, the leaf moves in accordance
with the preceding condition of tension; and as this is low
the leaf falls, soon to rise again as the tension increases in
prolonged darkness.</p>

<p>The above explanation presupposes: (1) that the tension
was continuously decreasing till the evening, and (2) that as
soon as the phototropic restraint which held the leaf up
was removed it fell down in accordance with the prevailing
diminished tension.</p>

<p>Referring to the first point, an inspection of the diurnal
curve of <i>Mimosa</i> shows that the leaf had no natural
tendency to fall towards the evening. There was on the
contrary a movement of erection, on account of fall of
temperature after the thermal-noon (Fig. 210). As the
natural tendency of the leaf was to erect itself, the removal
of phototropic restraint cannot therefore induce a movement
of fall.</p>

<p>As regards the factor of light, the effect in the afternoon
is a down-movement on account of transverse conduction
of excitation; but the leaf is prevented from exhibiting
this down-movement by the thermo-geotropic up-movement
due to fall of temperature after the thermal noon. I
shall presently describe experiments on the pure effect of
light, which will show that the action of continued photic
stimulus induces a down-movement of the leaf in the
afternoon.</p>

<p>The results of experiments that have been described show
that the sudden fall of the leaf in the evening could not
be due to:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(1) increased mechanical moment,</p>

<p>(2) the natural tendency of the leaf to fall towards
evening against phototropic action by which the
leaf is held up.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_591" id="Page_591">[Pg 591]</a></span></p>

<p>The above explanations having proved unsatisfactory we
have to search for other factors to account for the fall of
the leaf on the cessation of light. In this connection I
was struck by the extraordinary similarity of the diurnal
curve of the petiole of <i>Cassia alata</i> with that of <i>Mimosa</i>.</p>


<h4>DIURNAL CURVE OF THE PETIOLE OF <i>Cassia alata</i>.</h4>

<p><i>Experiment 224</i>.&mdash;The leaf of <i>Cassia</i> exhibits as in the
leaf of <i>Mimosa</i> a slight erectile movement after the thermal-noon
at 2 p.m., there is next a sudden fall after 5 p.m.,
which continues about 9 p.m.; after this the leaf exhibits
a continuous rise with the fall of temperature, till the climax
is reached about 6 a.m. in the morning; the leaf then
undergoes a fall with rise of temperature, there being a
number of pulsatory movements in the forenoon, evidently
due to unstable balance under the opposing effects of light
and of rise of temperature (Fig. 215).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 640px;">
<img src="images/fig-215.jpg" width="565" height="585" alt="Fig. 215." title="" /><br />
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 215.</span>&mdash;Diurnal record of <i>Cassia</i> leaf. Note similarity with diurnal record of
<i>Mimosa</i>.</p>
</div>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">[Pg 592]</a></span></p>

<p>The reason of this similarity between the records of
<i>Cassia</i> and <i>Mimosa</i> was found in the fact:</p>

<p>(1) That the main pulvinus of the leaf of <i>Cassia</i> is,
like the pulvinus of <i>Mimosa</i>, differentially excitable, the
lower half being more excitable than the upper. This is
demonstrated by sending a diffuse electric shock through
the leaf, the response being by a fall of the leaf due to the
greater contraction of the lower half of the pulvinus.
The leaf recovered after an interval of 20 minutes, the curve
of response being similar to that of <i>Mimosa</i>. The only
difference between the two organs is in the lesser excitability
of the pulvinus of <i>Cassia</i>, on account of which a
greater intensity of shock is necessary for producing the
responsive fall.</p>

<p>(2) The responses to light are the same in both as
will be seen in the following experiment.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 640px;">
<img src="images/fig-216.jpg" width="465" height="440" alt="Fig. 216." title="" /><br />
<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 216.</span>&mdash;Post-maximum after-effect of light on response of leaf of <i>Cassia</i>.
There is an over-shooting on cessation of light at arrow within a circle.</p>
</div>


<p><i>Experiment 225.</i>&mdash;In <i>Cassia</i>, as in <i>Mimosa</i>, light acting
from above induces at first an erectile movement which
reaches a maximum; after this there is a neutralisation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_593" id="Page_593">[Pg 593]</a></span>
and reversal. In the record given in figure 216, light
from a small arc lamp acting on the upper half of the
pulvinus for 48 minutes gave the maximum positive
curvature; this was completely neutralised by further
exposure to light for 20 minutes. Light was cut off at
neutralisation and there was a sudden fall beyond the
equilibrium position, which was more rapid than the
movement under light. The after-effect of prolonged
exposure is thus an 'over-shooting' beyond the normal position
of equilibrium.</p>


<h4>RESPONSE OF <i>Mimosa</i> TO DARKNESS AT DIFFERENT
PARTS OF THE DAY.</h4>

<p>I now tried the effect of darkness on the movement of
<i>Mimosa</i>, and was surprised to find that while artificial
darkness caused a sudden fall of the leaf in the afternoon,
it had no such effect in the forenoon.</p>

<p><i>Experiment 226.</i>&mdash;Successive records were taken of the
effect of artificial darkness for two hours, alternating with
exposure to light for two hours. The plant was subjected
to darkness by placing a piece of black cloth over the
glass cover from 12 to 2 p.m., it was exposed to light from
2 to 4 p.m. and darkened once more from 4 to 6 p.m.</p>

<p>The record given in figure 217 shows that the leaf had
been moving upwards under the action of light (positive
phototropism); darkness commenced at the point marked
with a thick dot. <i>The after-effect on the stoppage of light
is seen to be in the same direction as under light</i>; this
persisted for ten minutes followed by recovery which was
complete by 2 p.m., as seen in the horizontal character
of the curve. On restoration of light (at the point
marked with the second thick dot) the leaf moved upwards
till the positive phototropic movement attained a
maximum in the course of an hour and twenty minutes,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594">[Pg 594]</a></span>
after which neutralisation set in, and by 4 p.m. the positive
phototropic effect had become partially neutralised. Artificial
darkness at the third thick dot caused a rapid down-movement
which overshot the position of equilibrium.
The difference of after-effect in the forenoon and in the
afternoon lies in the fact that in the first case it was the
pre-maximum after-effect; but in the second case the
after-effect was post-maximum. I have already shown in
the previous chapter that the pre-maximum after-effect of
light is a short-lived movement in the same direction as
under light, while post-maximum after-effect was a rapid
over-shooting downwards beyond the equilibrium position.
These characteristics are also found in the after-effects
of light in <i>Mimosa</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 640px;">
<img src="images/fig-217.jpg" width="510" height="445" alt="Fig. 217." title="" /><br />
<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 217.</span>&mdash;Effect of periodic alternation of light L, and of darkness D, on
the response of <i>Mimosa</i> leaf. The first darkness causes the pre-maximal after-effect
of slight erection followed by recovery. The subsequent application of
light from 2 to 4 p.m. caused erectile movement followed by partial neutralisation
by 4 p.m. Stoppage of light at the third thick dot caused a sudden fall of
leaf <i>below</i> the position of equilibrium.</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_595" id="Page_595">[Pg 595]</a></span></p>

<p>The responses of <i>Mimosa</i> on the cessation of light
described above took place in the course of experiments
which lasted for more than six hours. Objection may be
raised that during this long period the temperature variation
must have produced certain effects on the response.
In order to meet this difficulty, I carried out the following
experiments which were completed in a relatively short
time. I have already explained how the period of experiment
could be shortened by suitable increase of the
intensity of light. The experiment was commenced inside
a room at noon and completed by 2 p.m.; the temperature
variation during this period was less than 1&deg;C.</p>

<p>In the above records light was applied at arrow, and stopped at the second
arrow enclosed in a circle.</p>
</div>


<p><i>After-effect at pre-maximum: Experiment 227.</i>&mdash;Light from
an 100 c.p. incandescent lamp was focussed on the upper
half of the pulvinus of <i>Mimosa</i> for 8 minutes, after which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_596" id="Page_596">[Pg 596]</a></span>
the light was turned off. The after-effect was a persistence
of previous movement followed by recovery (Fig.
218).</p>

<p><i>After-effect at maximum: Experiment 228.</i>&mdash;Continued
action of light for 18 minutes induced maximum positive
curvature as seen in the upper part of the curve becoming
horizontal. On the stoppage of light, there was a recovery
to the original position of equilibrium (Fig. 219).</p>

<p><i>After-effect at post-maximum: Experiment 229.</i>&mdash;A
fresh specimen of plant was taken for this experiment; it
exhibited maximum positive curvature after an exposure
of 20 minutes; continuation of light for a further period
of 17 minutes produced complete neutralisation. Stoppage
of light at this point, gave rise to a rapid down-movement
(Fig. 220) below the equilibrium position.</p>

<p>The experiments that have been described show that
the rapid fall of the leaf of <i>Mimosa</i> in the afternoon is
due to 'over-shooting' which is the after-effect of prolonged
action of light.</p>

<p>We are now in a position to give a full explanation
of the different phases of diurnal movement of the leaf
of <i>Mimosa</i>. The fall of the leaf commences from its
highest position at thermal-dawn at 6 a.m. in the
morning and continued till the thermal-noon at 2 p.m.
This is the thermo-geotropic reaction due to rise of temperature.
In the forenoon the phototropic action is positive,
and the fall of the leaf, due to rise of temperature, is
brought about in opposition to the action of light. The
temperature begins to fall after 2 p.m. and the leaf
begins to erect itself, and in the absence of any disturbing
factor would have continued its up-movement till
next morning. But light undergoes a rapid diminution
after 5 p.m. and the after-effect of light is an 'over-shooting'
in a downward direction. This fall continues
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_597" id="Page_597">[Pg 597]</a></span>till about 9 p.m., after which the leaf erects itself
under thermo-geotropic action of falling temperature, the
maximum erection being attained at the thermal-dawn at
about 6 a.m.</p>


<h4>SUMMARY.</h4>

<p>The very complex type of nyctitropic movement of
the primary petiole of <i>Mimosa</i> results from the combined
effects of thermo-geotropism and phototropism.</p>

<p>With the exception of a small portion of the curve in
the evening, the diurnal curve of <i>Mimosa</i> is similar to
the standard thermo-geotropic curve, where the leaf exhibits
an erectile movement from thermal-noon to thermal-dawn,
and a fall from thermal-dawn to thermal-noon.</p>

<p>Investigations show that the leaf of <i>Mimosa</i> has an
autonomous movement of its own, which persists throughout
twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>The torsional response of <i>Mimosa</i> exhibits a diurnal
variation similar to that exhibited by the leaf in normal
position.</p>

<p>The leaf of <i>Cassia alata</i> exhibits a diurnal movement
of the same type as that of <i>Mimosa</i>.</p>

<p>The spasmodic fall of the leaf towards evening is not
due to the increased mechanical moment caused by the
forward position of the sub-petioles. The record of the
leaf with amputated sub-petioles exhibits the sudden fall
in the evening as that of the intact leaf.</p>

<p>The evening fall of the leaf of <i>Mimosa</i> is shown to
be due to the post-maximum after-effect of light, which
causes an 'over-shooting', the leaf undergoing a fall
below the position of equilibrium.</p>

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
